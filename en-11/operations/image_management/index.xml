      <description>Image Management The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from compressed Kiwi image descriptions. These compressed Kiwi image descriptions are referred to as &amp;ldquo;recipes.&amp;rdquo; Kiwi-NG builds images based on a variety of different Linux distributions, specifically SUSE, RHEL, and their derivatives. Kiwi image descriptions must follow the Kiwi development schema. More information about the development schema and the Kiwi-NG tool can be found in the documentation: https://doc.</description>

      <description>Image Management Workflows Overview of how to create an image and how to customize and image.
The following workflows are intended to be high-level overviews of image management tasks. These workflows depict how services interact with each other during image management and help to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.
The workflows in this section include:
 Create a New Image Customize an Image  Create a New Image Use Case: The system administrator creates an image root from a customized recipe.</description>

      <description>Upload and Register an Image Recipe Download and expand recipe archives from S3 and IMS. Modify and upload a recipe archive, and then register that recipe archive with IMS.
Prerequisites  The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system. System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployment:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS)   The NCN Certificate Authority (CA) public key has been properly installed into the CA cache for this system.</description>

      <description>Build a New UAN Image Using the Default Recipe Build or rebuild the UAN image using either the default UAN image or image recipe. Both of these are supplied by the User Access Node (UAN) product stream installer.
Prerequisites  Both the Cray Operation System (COS) and UAN product streams must be installed. The Cray administrative CLI must be initialized.  Procedure The Cray EX User Access Node (UAN) recipe currently requires the Slingshot Diagnostics package, which is not installed with the UAN product itself.</description>

      <description>Build an Image Using IMS REST Service Create an image root from an IMS recipe.
Prerequisites  The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system. System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployments:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS) cray-nexus, the Nexus repository manager service   The NCN Certificate Authority (CA) public key has been properly installed into the CA cache for this system.</description>

      <description>Convert TGZ Archives to SquashFS Images If customizing a pre-built image root archive compressed as a txz or other non-SquashFS format, convert the image root to SquashFS and upload the SquashFS archive to S3.
The steps in this section only apply if the image root is not in SquashFS format.
Prerequisites There is a pre-built image that is not currently in SquashFS format.
Procedure   Locate the image root to be converted to SquashFS.</description>

      <title>Create UAN Boot Images</title>

      <description>Create UAN Boot Images Update configuration management git repository to match the installed version of the UAN product. Then use that updated configuration to create UAN boot images and a BOS session template.
This is the overall workflow for preparing UAN images for booting UANs:
 Clone the UAN configuration git repository and create a branch based on the branch imported by the UAN installation. Update the configuration content and push the changes to the newly created branch.</description>

      <title>Customize An Image Root Using IMS</title>
      <link>/docs-csm/en-11/operations/image_management/customize_an_image_root_using_ims/</link>

      <guid>/docs-csm/en-11/operations/image_management/customize_an_image_root_using_ims/</guid>
      <description>Customize an Image Root Using IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment.
Afterwards, the IMS customization workflow automatically copies the NCN CA public key to /etc/cray/ca/certificate_authority.crt within the image root being customized to enable secure communications between NCNs and client nodes.</description>

      <description>Delete or Recover Deleted IMS Content The Image Management System (IMS) manages user supplied SSH public Keys, customizable image recipes, images, and IMS jobs that are used to build or customize images. In previous versions of IMS, deleting an IMS public key, recipe, or image resulted in that item being permanently deleted. Additionally, IMS recipes and images store linked artifacts in the Simple Storage Service (S3) datastore. These artifacts are referenced by the IMS recipe and image records.</description>
