      <description>Domain Name Service (DNS) Overview DNS Architecture This diagram shows how the various components of the DNS infrastructure interact.
DNS Components The DNS infrastructure is comprised of a number of components.
Unbound (cray-dns-unbound) Unbound is a caching DNS resolver which is also used as the primary DNS server.
The DNS records served by Unbound include system component xnames, node hostnames, and service names and these records are read from the cray-dns-unbound ConfigMap which is populated by cray-dns-unbound-manager.</description>

      <description>Enable ncsd on UANs Configure User Access Nodes (UANs) to start the ncsd service at boot time.
The nscd service is not currently enabled by default and systemd does not start it at boot time. There are two ways to start nscd on UAN nodes: manually starting the service or enabling the service in the UAN image. While restarting nscd manually has to be performed each time the UAN is rebooted, enabling nscd in the image only has to be done once.</description>

      <description>Manage the DNS Unbound Resolver The unbound DNS instance is used to resolve names for the physical equipment on the management networks within the system, such as NCNs, UANs, switches, compute nodes, and more. This instance is accessible only within the HPE Cray EX system.
Check the Status of the cray-dns-unbound Pods Use the kubectl command to check the status of the pods:
ncn-w001# kubectl get -n services pods | grep unbound cray-dns-unbound-696c58647f-26k4c 2/2 Running 0 121m cray-dns-unbound-696c58647f-rv8h6 2/2 Running 0 121m cray-dns-unbound-coredns-q9lbg 0/2 Completed 0 121m cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-5rqxd 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-8ppv4 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-cwksv 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-dtm9p 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-hckmp 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-t24w6 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596149400-vzxnp 0/2 Completed 0 20h cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596222000-bcsk7 0/2 Completed 0 2m48s cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596222060-8pjx6 0/2 Completed 0 118s cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596222120-hrgbr 0/2 Completed 0 67s cray-dns-unbound-manager-1596222180-sf46q 1/2 NotReady 0 7s For more information about the pods displayed in the output above:</description>

      <description>PowerDNS Configuration External DNS PowerDNS replaces the CoreDNS server that earlier versions of CSM used to provide External DNS services.
The cray-dns-powerdns-can-tcp and cray-dns-powerdns-can-udp LoadBalancer resources are configured to service external DNS requests using the IP address specified by the CSI --can-external-dns command line argument.
The CSI --system-name and --site-domain command line arguments are combined to form the subdomain used for External DNS.
Site setup In the following example, the IP address 10.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot Common DNS Issues The Domain Name Service (DNS) is part of an integrated infrastructure set designed to provide dynamic host discovery, addressing, and naming. There are several different place to look for troubleshooting as DNS interacts with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the Hardware Management Service (HMS), the System Layout Service (SLS), and the State Manager Daemon (SMD).
The information below describes what to check when experiencing issues with DNS.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot PowerDNS List DNS Zone Contents The PowerDNS zone database is populated with data from two sources:
 The cray-powerdns-manager service creates the zones and DNS records based on data sourced from the System Layout Service (SLS) The external DNS records are populated by the cray-externaldns-external-dns service using data sourced from Kubernetes annotations and virtual service definitions  Use the cray-powerdns-visualizer command to view the zone structure that cray-powerdns-manager will create.</description>
