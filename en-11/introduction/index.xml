      <description>Documentation Conventions Several conventions have been used in the preparation of this documentation.
 Markdown Format File Formats Typographic Conventions Command Prompt Conventions which describe the context for user, host, directory, chroot environment, or container environment  Markdown Format This documentation is in Markdown format. Although much of it can be viewed with any text editor, a richer experience will come from using a tool which can render the Markdown to show different font sizes, the use of bold and italics formatting, inclusion of diagrams and screen shots as image files, and to follow navigational links within a topic file and to other files.</description>

      <description>CSM Overview This CSM Overview describes the Cray System Management ecosystem with its hardware, software, and network. It describes how to access these services and components.
The CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.</description>
