      <description>BOS/BOA Incorrect command is output to rerun a failed operation. When the Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA), an agent of the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS), encounters a failure, it issues a command to rerun the operation for any nodes that experienced the failure. However, the syntax of this command is faulty.
The faulty command includes squiggly braces around a comma separated list of quoted nodes. These squiggly braces, single quotes, and the spaces separating the individual nodes all need to be removed.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot System Clock Skew Resynchronize system clocks after Ceph reports a clock skew.
Systems use chronyd to synchronize their system clocks. If systems are not able to communicate, then the clocks can drift, causing clock skew. Another reason for this issue would be an individual manually changing the clocks or a task that may change the clocks and require a series of steps (time adjustments) to resynchronize.
Major time jumps where the clock is set back in time will require a full restart of all Ceph services.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot Pods Failing to Restart on Other Worker Nodes Troubleshoot an issue where pods cannot restart on another worker node because of the &amp;ldquo;Volume is already exclusively attached to one node and can&amp;rsquo;t be attached to another&amp;rdquo; error. Kubernetes does not currently support &amp;ldquo;readwritemany&amp;rdquo; access mode for Rados Block Device (RBD) devices, which causes an issue where devices fail to unmap correctly.
The issue occurs when unmounting the mounts tied to the RBD devices, which causes the rbd-task (watcher) to not stop for the RBD device.</description>

      <description>Ceph Orchestrator General Usage and Tips Description &amp;ldquo;Is a module that provides a command line interface (CLI) to orchestrator modules (ceph-mgr modules which interface with external orchestration services).&amp;rdquo; - source (https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/mgr/orchestrator/)
This provides a nice centralized interface for the management of the ceph cluster. This includes:
 Single command upgrades, assuming all images are in place. Reduces the need to be on the physical server to address a large number of ceph service restarts or configuration changes Better integration with the Ceph Dashboard (Coming soon) Ability to write custom orchestration modules  Troubleshooting Ceph Orchestrator Watching cephadm Log Messages This is useful when making changes via the orchestrator like add/remove/scale services or upgrades.</description>

      <description>System Management Health Checks and Alerts A health check corresponds to a Prometheus query against metrics aggregated to the Prometheus instance. Core platform components like Kubernetes and Istio collect service-related metrics by default, which enables the System Management Health service to implement generic service health checks without custom instrumentation. Health checks are intended to be coarse-grained and comprehensive, as opposed to fine-grained and exhaustive. Health checks related to infrastructure adhere to the Utilization Saturation Errors (USE) method whereas services follow the Rate Errors Duration (RED) method.</description>

The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic-curve (ECC) are some example algorithm systems.
The use of PKI for the system is in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is the successor of the now deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This is where trusted chains of Certificate Authorities (CAs) are used to authenticate the identity of servers, and sometimes clients (for example, mutual TLS) for relying parties.</description>

      <description>Keycloak Operations A service may need to access Keycloak to perform various tasks. These typical uses for a service to access Keycloak include creating a new service account, creating a new user, etc. These operations require Keycloak administrative access. As part of the System Management Services (SMS) installation process, Keycloak is initialized with a Master realm. An administrative client and user are created within this realm. The system installation process adds the information needed for the Keycloak administrator&amp;rsquo;s authentication into a Kubernetes secret that can be accessed by any pod.</description>

      <description>API Authorization Authorization for REST API calls is only done at the API gateway. This is facilitated through policy checks to the Open Policy Agent (OPA). Every REST API call into the system is sent to the OPA to make an authorization decision. The decision is based on the Authenticated JSON Web Token (JWT) passed into the request.
The following is a list of available personas and the supported REST API endpoints for each:</description>

      <description>Power Management HPE Cray System Management (CSM) software manages and controls power out-of-band through Redfish APIs. Note that power management features are &amp;ldquo;asynchronous,&amp;rdquo; in that the client must determine whether the component status has changed after a power management API call returns.
In-band power management features are not supported in v1.4.
HPE supports Slurm as a workload manager which reports job energy usage and records it in the ITDB for system accounting purposes.</description>

      <description>Recreate StatefulSet Pods on Another Node Some pods are members of StatefulSets, meaning that there is a very specific number of them, each likely running on a different node. Similar to DaemonSets, these pods will never be recreated on another node as long as they are sitting in a Terminating state.
Warning: This procedure should only be done for pods that are known to no longer be running. Corruption may occur if the worker node is still running when deleting the deleting the StatefulSet pod in a Terminating state.</description>

      <description>Resilience of System Management Services HPE Cray EX systems are designed so that system management services (SMS) are fully resilient and that there is no single point of failure. The design of the system allows for resiliency in the following ways:
 Three non-compute nodes (NCNs) are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. When one master goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes.</description>

      <description>Restore System Functionality if a Kubernetes Worker Node is Down Services running on Kubernetes worker nodes can be properly restored if downtime occurs. Use this procedure to ensure that if a Kubernetes worker node is lost or restored after being down, certain features the node was providing can also be restored or recovered on another node.
Capture the metadata for the unhealthy node before bringing down the node. The pods will successfully terminate when the node goes down, which should resolve most pods in an error state.</description>

      <description>Manage Repositories with Nexus This section describes how to connect to Nexus with the Web UI, as well as how to access the REST API from non-compute nodes (NCNs) or compute nodes to manage repositories.
Access Nexus with the Web UI Use the hostname set in istio.ingress.hosts.ui.authority (see below) to connect to Nexus over the Customer Access Network (CAN) using a web browser. For example:
https://nexus.{{network.dns.external}}/ Users will be redirected to Keycloak to log in, and based on the default OPA policy, only admin users will be authorized.</description>

      <description>Nexus Configuration Expect each product to create and use its own File type blob store. For example, the Cray System Management (CSM) product uses csm.
The default blob store is also available, but Cray products are discouraged from using it.
Repositories CSM creates the registry (format docker) and charts (format helm) repositories for managing container images and Helm charts across all Cray products. However, each product&amp;rsquo;s release may contain a number of RPM repositories that are added to Nexus.</description>

      <description>Nexus Deployment Nexus is deployed with the cray-nexus chart to the nexus namespace as part of the Cray System Management (CSM) release. Nexus is deployed after critical platform services are up and running. Product installers configure and populate Nexus blob stores and repositories using the cray-nexus-setup container image. As a result, there is no singular product that provides all Nexus repositories or assets; instead, individual products must be installed. However, CSM configures the charts Helm repository and the registry Docker repository, which all products may use.</description>

      <description>Repair Yum Repository Metadata Nexus may have trouble (re)generating repository metadata (for example, repodata/repomd.xml), especially for larger repositories. Configure the Repair - Rebuild Yum repository metadata (repodata) task in Nexus to create the metadata if the standard generation fails. This is not typically needed, which makes it a repair task.
The example in this procedure is for creating a repair task to rebuild Yum metadata for the mirror-1.3.0-opensuse-leap-15 repository.

      <description>Node Management The HPE Cray EX systems include two node types:
 Compute Nodes that run high-performance computing applications and are named nidXXXXXX. Every system must contain four or more compute nodes, starting at nid000001. Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs) that carry out system management functions as part of the management Kubernetes cluster. NCNs outside of the Kubernetes cluster function as application nodes (AN).  Nine or more management NCNs host system services:</description>

      <description>Reboot NCNs The following is a high-level overview of the non-compute node (NCN) reboot workflow:
 Run the NCN pre-reboot checks and procedures:  Ensure ncn-m001 is not running in &amp;ldquo;LiveCD&amp;rdquo; or install mode Check the metal.no-wipe settings for all NCNs Run all platform health checks, including checks on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering sessions Validate the current boot order   Run the rolling NCN reboot procedure:  Loop through reboots on storage nodes, worker nodes, and master nodes, where each boot consists of the following workflow: - Establish console session with node to reboot - Execute a Linux graceful shutdown or power off/on sequence to the node to allow it to boot up to completion - Execute NCN/platform health checks and do not go on to reboot the next NCN until health has been ensured on the most recently rebooted NCN - Disconnect console session with the node that was rebooted   Re-run all platform health checks, including checks on BGP peering sessions  The time duration for this procedure (if health checks are being executed in between each boot, as recommended) could take between two to four hours for a system with nine management nodes.</description>

      <description>Management Network Switch Rename Any system moving from Shasta v1.3 to Shasta v1.4 software needs to adjust the hostnames and IP addresses for all switches to match the new standard. There is now a virtual IP address ending in .1 which is used by spine switches. In Shasta v1.3, the first spine switch used the .1 address. In Shasta v1.4, the ordering of the switches has changed with spine switches being grouped first.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot Connectivity to Services with External IP addresses Systems that do not support CAN will not have services provisioned with external IP addresses on CAN. Kubernetes will report a &amp;lt;pending&amp;gt; status for the external IP address of the service experiencing connectivity issues.
If SSH access to a non-compute node (NCN) is available, it is possible to override resolution of external hostnames and forward local ports into the cluster for the cluster IP address of the corresponding service.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot DNS Configuration Issues Troubleshoot issues when DNS is not properly configured to delegate name resolution to the core DNS instance on a specific cluster. Although the CAN IP address may still be routable using the IP address directly, it may not work because Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway depends on the hostname (or SNI) to route traffic. For command line tools like cURL, using the &amp;ndash;resolve option to force correct resolution can be used to work around this issue.</description>

      <description>Update the can-external-dns Value Post-Installation By default, the services/cray-externaldns-coredns-tcp and services/cray-externaldns-coredns-udp services both share the same Customer Access Network (CAN) external IP as defined by the can-external-dns value. This value is specified during the csi config init input.
It is expected to be in the static range reserved in MetalLB&amp;rsquo;s can-dynamic-pool subnet. Theoretically, this is the only CAN IP address that must be known external to the system so IT DNS can delegate the system-name.</description>

The nscd service is not currently enabled by default and systemd does not start it at boot time. There are two ways to start nscd on UAN nodes: manually starting the service or enabling the service in the UAN image. While restarting nscd manually has to be performed each time the UAN is rebooted, enabling nscd in the image only has to be done once.</description>

      <description>External DNS Failing to Discover Services Workaround Many external DNS issues can be worked around by directly connecting to the desired backend service. This can circumvent authentication and authorization protections, but it may be necessary to access specific services when mitigating critical issues.
Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway uses Gateway and VirtualService objects to configure how traffic is routed to backend services. Currently, there is only one Gateway supporting the Customer Access Network (CAN), which is services/services-gateway.</description>

      <description>Ingress Routing Ingress routing to services via Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway is configured by VirtualService custom resource definitions (CRD). When using external hostnames, there needs to be a VirtualService CRD that matches the external hostname to the desired destination.
For example, the configuration below controls the ingress routing for prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME:
ncn-w001# kubectl get vs -n sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus [services/services-gateway] [prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 22h ncn-w001# kubectl get vs -n sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus -o yaml apiVersion: networking.</description>

      <description>Externally Exposed Services The following services are exposed on the Customer Access Network (CAN). Each of these services requires an IP address on the CAN subnet so they are reachable on the CAN. This IP address is allocated by the MetalLB component.
Services under Istio Ingress Gateway and Keycloak Gatekeeper Ingress share an ingress, so they all use the IP allocated to the Ingress.
Each service is given a DNS name that is served by the External DNS service to make them resolvable from the site network.</description>

If the Customer Access Network (CAN) is not configured on the system, these services will need to be pinned to ncn-m001 because that is the only node that has external access. See Customer Access Network (CAN) for more implications if CAN is not configured.

The most frequent issue with the Customer Access Network (CAN) is trouble accessing IP addresses outside of the HPE Cray EX system from a node or pod inside the system.
The best way to resolve this issue is to try to ping an outside IP address from one of the NCNs other than ncn-m001, which has a direct connection that it can use instead of the Customer Access Network (CAN).</description>

      <description>Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority.</description>

      <description>Default IP Address Ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These IP address default ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.
The following table shows the default IP address ranges:

      <description>Kubernetes The system management components are broken down into a series of micro-services. Each service is independently deployable, fine-grained, and uses lightweight protocols. As a result, the system&amp;rsquo;s micro-services are modular, resilient, and can be updated independently. Services within this architecture communicate via REST APIs.

Resource requests can be provided explicitly for pods and containers, whereas pod QoS is implicit, based on the resource requests and limits of the containers in the pod. There are three types of QoS:
 Guaranteed: All containers in a pod have explicit memory and CPU resource requests and limits. For each resource, the limit equals the request.</description>

      <description>Determine if Pods are Hitting Resource Limits Determine if a pod is being CPU throttled or hitting its memory limits (OOMKilled). Use the detect_cpu_throttling.sh script to determine if any pods are being CPU throttled, and check the Kubernetes events to see if any pods are hitting a memory limit.
IMPORTANT: The presence of CPU throttling does not always indicate a problem, but if a service is being slow or experiencing latency issues, this procedure can be used to evaluate if it is not performing well as a result of CPU throttling.</description>

      <description>About etcd The system uses etcd for storing all of its cluster data. It is an open source database that is excellent for maintaining the state of Kubernetes. Failures in the etcd cluster at the heart of Kubernetes will cause a failure of Kubernetes. To mitigate this risk, the system is deployed with etcd on dedicated disks and with a specific configuration to optimize Kubernetes workloads. The system also provides additional etcd cluster(s) as necessary to help maintain an operational state of services.</description>

      <description>About Kubernetes Taints and Labels Kubernetes labels control node affinity, which is the property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes. On the other hand, Kubernetes taints enable a node to repel a set of pods. In addition, pods can have tolerances for taints to allow them to run on nodes with certain taints.
Taints are controlled with the kubectl taint nodes command, while node labels for various nodes can be customized with a configmap that contains the desired values.</description>

Not all services are backed up automatically. Services that are not backed up automatically will need to be manually rediscovered if the cluster is unhealthy.
Clusters with Automated Backups The following services are backed up (daily, one week&amp;rsquo;s worth of backups retained) as part of the automated solution:
 Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) Boot Script Service (BSS) Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) External DNS Firmware Action Service (FAS)  Run the following command on any master node (ncn-mXXX) or the first worker node (ncn-w001) to list the backups for a specific project.</description>

      <description>Hardware Management Services (HMS) Locking API The locking feature is a part of the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. The locking API enables administrators to lock xnames on the system. Locking xnames ensures other system actors, such as administrators or running services, cannot perform a firmware update with the Firmware Action Service (FAS) or a power state change with the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC). Locks only constrain FAS and CAPMC from each other and help ensure that a firmware update action will not be interfered with by a request to power off the device through CAPMC.</description>

      <description>HSM Roles and Subroles The Hardware State Manager (HSM) contains several pre-defined roles and subroles that can be assigned to components and used to target specific hardware devices.
Roles and subroles assignments come from the System Layout Service (SLS) and are applied by HSM when a node is discovered.
HSM Roles The following is a list of all pre-defined roles:
 Management Compute Application Service System Storage  The Management role refers to NCNs and will generally have the Master, Worker, or Storage subrole assigned.</description>

      <description>Use a Custom ansible-cfg File The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) allows for flexibility with the Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) by allowing for changes to included ansible.cfg file. When installed, CFS imports a custom ansible.cfg file into the cfs-default-ansible-cfg Kubernetes ConfigMap in the services namespace.
Administrators who want to make changes to the ansible.cfg file on a per-session or system-wide basis can upload a new file to a new ConfigMap and direct CFS to use their file.</description>

      <description>Use a Specific Inventory in a Configuration Session A special repository can be added to a Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configuration to help with certain scenarios, specifically when developing Ansible plays for use on the system. A static inventory often changes along with the Ansible content, and CFS users may need to test different configuration values simultaneously and not be forced to use the global additionalInventoryUrl.
Therefore, an additional_inventory mapping can be added to the CFS configuration.</description>

Typically, this repository is of the following form and exists in the cray organization in VCS:
[product name]-config-management The import branch of the product is considered &amp;ldquo;pristine content&amp;rdquo; and is added to VCS in a read-only branch. This step is taken to ensure the future updates of the product&amp;rsquo;s configuration content can be based on a clean branch, and that the upgrade procedure can proceed without merging issues.</description>

      <description>Ansible Execution Environments Configuration Framework Service (CFS) sessions are comprised of a single Kubernetes pod with several containers. Inventory and Git clone setup containers run first, and a teardown container runs last (if the session is running an image customization).
The containers that run the Ansible code cloned from the Git repositories in the configuration layers are Ansible Execution Environments (AEE). The AEE is provided as a SLES-based docker image, which includes Ansible version 2.</description>

      <description>Ansible Inventory The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) provides several options for targeting nodes or boot images for configuration by Ansible. The contents of the Ansible inventory determine which nodes are available for configuration in each CFS session and how default configuration values can be customized.
The following are the inventory options provided by CFS:
 Dynamic inventory Static inventory Image Customization  Dynamic Inventory and Host Groups Dynamic inventory is the default inventory when creating a CFS session.</description>

      <description>Automatic Session Deletion with sessionTTL By default, when a session completes, the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) will delete sessions and Kubernetes jobs associated with the session when the start date was more than seven days prior. This is done to ensure CFS sessions do not accumulate and eventually adversely affect the performance of the Kubernetes cluster.
For larger systems or systems that do frequent reboots of nodes that are configured with CFS sessions, this setting may need to be reduced.</description>

      <description>BOS Limitations for Gigabyte BMC Hardware Special steps need to be taken when using the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) to boot, reboot, shutdown, or configure Gigabyte hardware. Gigabyte hardware treats power off and power on requests as successful, regardless of if actually successfully completed. The power on/off requests are ignored by Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) if they are received within a short period of time, which is typically around 60 seconds per operation.</description>

      <description>Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Duplicate Address Warnings and Declined DHCP Offers in Logs If the DHCP and node logs show duplicate address warnings and indicate declined DHCP offers, it may be because another component owns the IP address that DHCP is trying to assign to a node. If this happens, the node will not accept the IP address and will repeatedly submit a DHCP discover request. As a result, the node and DHCP become entangled in a loop of requesting and rejecting.</description>

See the https://docs.ceph.com/docs/mimic/radosgw/s3/ for more information about compatibility. The object gateway is also referred to as the RADOS gateway or simply RGW.
S3 is an object storage service that provides high-level performance, scalability, security, and data availability.</description>

      <description>Manage Artifacts with the Cray CLI The artifacts (objects) available for use on the system are created and managed with the Cray CLI. The cray artifacts command provides the ability to manage any given artifact. The Cray CLI automatically authenticates users and provides Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials.
All operations with the cray artifacts command assume that the user has already been authenticated. If the user has not been authenticated with the Cray CLI, run the following command and enter the appropriate credentials:</description>

      <description>User Access Service (UAS) The User Access Service (UAS) is a containerized service managed by Kubernetes that enables application developers to create and run user applications. UAS runs on a non-compute node (NCN) that is acting as a Kubernetes worker node.
Users launch a User Access Instance (UAI) using the cray command. Users can also transfer data between the Cray system and external systems using the UAI.
When a user requests a new UAI, the UAS service returns status and connection information to the newly created UAI.</description>

      <description>Volumes Volumes provide a way to connect UAIs to external data, whether they be Kubernetes managed objects, external file systems or files, host node files and directories, or remote networked data to be used within the UAI.
The following are examples of how volumes are commonly used by UAIs:
 To connect UAIs to configuration files like /etc/localtime maintained by the host node To connect end-user UAIs to Slurm or PBS Professional Workload Manager configuration shared through Kubernetes To connect end-user UAIs to Programming Environment libraries and tools hosted on the UAI host nodes To connect end-user UAIs to Lustre or other external storage for user data To connect broker UAIs to a directory service (see Configure a Broker UAI Class) or SSH configuration (see Customize the Broker UAI Image) needed to authenticate and redirect user sessions  Any kind of volume recognized by the Kubernetes installation can be installed as a volume within UAS and will be used when creating UAIs.</description>

      <description>UAI macvlans Network Attachments UAIs need to be able to reach compute nodes across the node management network (NMN). When the compute node NMN is structured as multiple subnets, this requires routing form the UAIs to those subnets. The default route in a UAI goes to the public network through the Customer Access Network (CAN) so that will not work for reaching compute nodes. To solve this problem, UAS installs Kubernetes network attachments within the Kubernetes user namespace, one of which is used by UAIs.</description>

      <description>UAI Management UAS supports two manual methods and one automated method of UAI management:
 Direct administrative UAI management Legacy mode user driven UAI management UAI broker mode UAI management  Direct administrative UAI management is available mostly to allow administrators to set up UAI brokers for the UAI broker mode of UAI management and to control UAIs that are created under one of the other two methods. It is unlikely that a site will choose to create end-user UAIs this way, but it is possible to do.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Sometimes there is no better way to figure out a problem with a UAI than to get inside it and look around as an administrator. This is done using kubectl exec to start a shell inside the running container as &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; (in the container). With this an administrator can diagnose problems, make changes to the running UAI and find solutions. It is important to remember that any change made inside a UAI is transitory.</description>

It is possible to see errors reported by elements of the UAI entrypoint script using the kubectl logs command. First find the UAI of interest. This starts by identifying the UAI name using the CLI:
ncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais list [[results]] uai_age = &amp;quot;4h30m&amp;quot; uai_connect_string = &amp;quot;ssh broker@10.103.13.162&amp;quot; uai_host = &amp;quot;ncn-w001&amp;quot; uai_img = &amp;quot;dtr.</description>

      <description>Reset the UAS Configuration to Original Installed Settings How to remove a customized UAS configuration and restore the base installed configuration.
The configuration set up using the Cray CLI to interact with UAS persists as long as UAS remains installed and survives upgrades. This is called the running configuration and it is both persistent and malleable. During installation and localization, however, the installer creates a base installed configuration. It may be necessary to return to this base configuration.</description>

      <description>Resource Specifications Kubernetes uses resource limits and resource requests, to manage the system resources available to pods. Because UAIs run as pods under Kubernetes, UAS takes advantage of Kubernetes to manage the system resources available to UAIs.
In the UAS configuration, resource specifications contain that configuration. A UAI that is assigned a resource specification will use that instead of the default resource limits or requests on the Kubernetes namespace containing the UAI.</description>

      <description>Select and Configure Host Nodes for UAIs Site administrators can control the set of UAI host nodes by labeling Kubernetes worker nodes appropriately.
UAIs run on NCNs that function as Kubernetes worker nodes. Use Kubernetes labels to prevent UAIs from running on one or more specific worker nodes. Any Kubernetes node that is not labeled to prevent UAIs from running on it is considered to be a UAI host node. In other words, UAI host node selection is an exclusive activity, not an inclusive one.</description>

      <description>Special Purpose UAIs Even though most UAIs are end-user UAIs, UAI classes make it possible to construct UAIs to serve special purposes that are not strictly end-user oriented.
One kind of special purpose UAI is the broker UAI, which provides on demand end-user UAI launch and management (see Broker Mode UAI Management). While no other specialty UAI types currently exist, other applications are expected to arise and users are encouraged to innovate as needed.</description>

      <description>End-User UAIs UAIs used for interactive logins are called end-user UAIs. End-user UAIs can be seen as lightweight User Access Nodes (UANs), but there are important differences between UAIs and UANs. First, end-user UAIs are not dedicated hardware like UANs. They are implemented as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, which makes them subject to Kubernetes scheduling and resource management rules. One key element of Kubernetes orchestration is impermanence. While end-user UAIs are often long running, Kubernetes can reschedule or recreate them as needed to meet resource and node availability constraints.</description>

      <description>Customize the Broker UAI Image The broker UAI image that comes with UAS is the image used to construct broker UAIs.
The key pieces of the broker UAI image are:
 An entrypoint shell script that initializes the container and starts the SSH daemon running. An SSH configuration that forces logged in users into the switchboard command which creates / selects end-user UAIs and redirects connections.  The primary way to customize the broker UAI image is by defining volumes and connecting them to the broker UAI class for a given broker.</description>

      <description>Configure a Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode Using a default UAI class is optional but recommended for any site using the legacy UAI management mode that wants to have some control over UAIs created by users. UAI classes used for this purpose need to have certain minimum configuration in them:
 The image_id field set to identify the image used to construct UAIs The volume_list field set to the list of volumes to mount in UAIs The public_ip field set to true The uai_compute_network flag set to true (if workload management will be used) The default flag set to true to make this the default UAI class  To make UAIs useful, there is a minimum set of volumes that should be defined in the UAS configuration:</description>

      <description>Post-Install Customizations Post-install customizations may be needed as systems scale. These customizations also need to persist across future installs or upgrades. Not all resources can be customized post-install; common scenarios are documented in the following sections.
The following is a guide for determining where issues may exist, how to adjust the resources, and how to ensure the changes will persist. Different values may be be needed for systems as they scale.</description>

      <guid>/docs-csm/en-11/operations/csm_product_management/configure_keycloak_account/</guid>
      <description>Configure Keycloak Account Installation of CSM software includes a default account for administrative access to keycloak.
Depending on choices made during the installation, there may be a federated connection to an external Identity Provider (IdP), such as an LDAP or AD server, which enables the use of external accounts in keycloak.
However, if the external accounts are not available, then an &amp;ldquo;internal user account&amp;rdquo; could be created in keycloak. Having a usable account in keycloak with administrative authorization enables the use of the cray CLI for many administrative commands, such as those used to Validate CSM Health and general operation of the management services via the API gateway.</description>

      <description>Reset root Password on LiveCD It may become desirable to clear the password on the LiveCD.
The root password is preserved within the COW partition at cow:rw/etc/shadow. This is the modified copy of the /etc/shadow file used by the operating system.
If a site/user needs to reset/clear the password for root, they can mount their USB on another machine and remove this file from the COW partition. When next booting from the USB it will reinitialize to an empty password for root, and again at next login it will require the password to be changed.</description>

      <description>Redeploy PIT Node The following procedure contains information for rebooting and deploying the management node that is currently hosting the LiveCD. This assists with remote-console setup to aid in observing the reboot. At the end of this procedure, the LiveCD will no longer be active. The node it was using will join the Kubernetes cluster as the final of three master nodes forming a quorum.
Important: While the node is rebooting, it will be available only through Serial-over-LAN and local terminals.</description>

      <description>Deploy Management Nodes The following procedure deploys Linux and Kubernetes software to the management NCNs. Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes followed by the master nodes and worker nodes together. After the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process completes for all nodes, the Ceph storage is initialized and the Kubernetes cluster is created and ready for a workload.</description>

      <description>Clear Gigabyte CMOS Because of a bug in the Gigabyte firmware, the Shasta 1.5 install may negatively impact Gigabyte motherboards when attempting to boot using bonded Mellanox network cards. The result is a board that is unusable until a CMOS clear is physically done via a jumper on the board itself.
A patched firmware release (newer than C20 BIOS) is expected to be available for a future release of Shasta. It is recommended that Gigabyte users wait for this new firmware before attempting an installation of Shasta 1.</description>

 Management node SquashFS images are always SLE_HPC (SuSE High Performance Computing) Utility Storage nodes Ceph Images are always SLE_HPC (SuSE High Performance Computing) with SES (SuSE Enterprise Storage)  The sles-release RPM is uninstalled for NCNs, and instead, the sle_HPC-release RPM is installed. These both provide the same files, but differ for os-release and /etc/product.d/baseproduct.
The ses-release RPM is installed on top of the sle_HPC-release RPM in the Ceph images.</description>
