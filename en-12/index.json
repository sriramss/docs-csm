	"content": "Prepare for Upgrade Before beginning an upgrade to a new version of CSM, there are a few things to do on the system first.\n  Understand that management service resiliency is reduced during the upgrade.\nWarning: Although it is expected that compute nodes and application nodes will continue to provide their services without interruption, it is important to be aware that the degree of management services resiliency is reduced during the upgrade. If, while one node is being upgraded, another node of the same type has an unplanned fault that removes it from service, there may be a degraded system. For example, if there are three Kubernetes master nodes and one is being upgraded, the quorum is maintained by the remaining two nodes. If one of those two nodes has a fault before the third node completes its upgrade, then quorum would be lost.\n  Optional system health checks.\n  Use the System Diagnostic Utility (SDU) to capture current state of system before the shutdown.\nImportant: SDU takes about 15 minutes to run on a small system (longer for large systems).\nncn-m001# sdu --scenario triage --start_time \u0026#39;-4 hours\u0026#39; \\ --reason \u0026#34;saving state before powerdown/up\u0026#34; Refer to the HPE Cray EX System Diagnostic Utility (SDU) Administration Guide for more information and troubleshooting steps.\n  Check Ceph status.\nncn-m001# ceph -s | tee ceph.status   Check Kubernetes pod status for all pods.\nncn-m001# kubectl get pods -o wide -A | tee k8s.pods Additional Kubernetes status check examples :\nncn-m001# egrep \u0026#34;CrashLoopBackOff\u0026#34; k8s.pods | tee k8s.pods.CLBO ncn-m001# egrep \u0026#34;ContainerCreating\u0026#34; k8s.pods | tee k8s.pods.CC ncn-m001# egrep -v \u0026#34;Run|Completed\u0026#34; k8s.pods | tee k8s.pods.errors     Check for running sessions.\nEnsure that these services do not have any sessions in progress: BOS, CFS, CRUS, FAS, or NMD.\n This SAT command has shutdown as one of the command line options, but it will not start a shutdown process on the system.\n ncn-m001# sat bootsys shutdown --stage session-checks Example output:\nChecking for active BOS sessions. Found no active BOS sessions. Checking for active CFS sessions. Found no active CFS sessions. Checking for active CRUS upgrades. Found no active CRUS upgrades. Checking for active FAS actions. Found no active FAS actions. Checking for active NMD dumps. Found no active NMD dumps. No active sessions exist. It is safe to proceed with the shutdown procedure. If active sessions are running, either wait for them to complete or shut down/cancel/delete the session.\n  Coordinate with the site to prevent new sessions from starting in the services listed (BOS, CFS, CRUS, FAS, NMD).\nIn version Shasta v1.5, there is no method to prevent new sessions from being created as long as the service APIs are accessible on the API gateway.\n  Validate CSM Health\nRun the CSM health checks to ensure that everything is working properly before the upgrade starts.\nIMPORTANT: See the CSM Install Validation and Health Checks procedures in the documentation for your CURRENT CSM version. The validation procedures in the CSM 1.2 documentation are not all intended to work on previous versions of CSM.\n  Validate Lustre Health\nIf a Lustre file system is being used, see the ClusterStor documentation for details on how to check for Lustre health. Here are a few commands which could be used to validate Lustre health. This example is for a ClusterStor providing the cls01234 filesystem.\n  SSH to the primary management node.

	"description": "",
	"content": "SLS Updates Expert Mode The 1.2 SLS Upgrader aims to make the upgrade of SLS from pre-CMS 1.2 to CSM 1.2 as seamless as possible. However, certain system constraints and subnet sizes quickly necessitate overriding standard input.\nKey Takeaways\n EXPERT MODE: requires both an iterative (offline) process and command line override values. The output from the upgrade is a file, not uploaded live to the system. The output logs from an upgrade run should be reviewed to ensure that input values and upgrader subnetting has the desired effect.  When to use Expert Mode\n Both external-dns and ncn IPs need to be preserved. Subnets created by the upgrader are in the wrong order, too small or a subnet size and location in a network needs to be enforced. Running in non-expert mode generates errors. Running in non-expert mode generates warnings for which remediation is desired.  Simple/Minimal Input Review At a minimum the upgrader requires only two inputs:\n SLS input file: This is a file extract of SLS to be upgraded. Bifurcated CAN path for non-administrator traffic: Selection of CAN or CHN depending on whether User traffic (users running jobs, not administrators) will access the system over the management network CAN or the highspeed network (CHN).  An example of this would be:\n./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CAN The above example will use default values for all other input values. A list of input parameters and default values can be found by running ./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py --help. Likely using default VLAN and Network values will not be what\u0026rsquo;s desired: The CAN or CHN are usually site-routable values.\nIn this case an example minimal usable input while using CAN, would be:\n./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CAN \\  --customer-access-network \u0026lt;CAN VLAN ID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CAN NETORK CIDR\u0026gt; For CHN the analog minimal usable input would be:\n./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CHN \\  --customer-highspeed-network \u0026lt;CHN VLAN ID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CHN NETWORK CIDR\u0026gt; Forcing Preservation of (some) Existing Values As part of the upgrade process an exist CAN is migrated to a CSM 1.2 Customer Management Network (CMN). The reasoning behind this was that most systems in production currently use the CAN as an administrative network. Additionally, and more operationally important, system IPs shared with the site (External DNS for instance) are administrative IPs and it\u0026rsquo;s often more difficult to change these IP\u0026rsquo;s than to make changes in software and avoid operational changes.\nTo allow some semblance of control over the need to preserve one or more IPs (existing CAN, migrated CMN only), the --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn was introduced. --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn has two possible values:\n external-dns: This is the IP by which customer/site DNS lookups to system internal (K8S services) DNS happen. Often changing this requires operational change control from the site. NOTE: --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns is the most frequent use of this command line flag. ncns: During the migration of CAN to CMN, all system switches need to be added to a (new) network_hardware subnet inside the CMN Network. Without guidance NCN IPs for the existing CAN (as it\u0026rsquo;s migrated to CMN) will shift to allow the new network_hardware subnet. Using --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn ncns will prevent changes to CMN NCN IPs (note: managers, workers and stoage only) during the upgrade process.  Note that external-dns preservation is mutually exclusive from ncns. This is the last easy button before full \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; mode is required.\nA very common (and recommended) next step minimal command line is as follows for a system desiring the CHN with no change of the external-dns value is:\n./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CHN \\  --customer-highspeed-network \u0026lt;CHN VLAN ID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CHN NETWORK CIDR\u0026gt; \\  --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns This would create a new CHN and migrate the existing CAN to the new CMN while maintaining the external-dns IP address in the process. Note that this command line would very likely change existing CAN/CMN addresses on manager, worker and storage K8S NCNs during the upgrade to CSM 1.2.\nNOTE: The output of the upgrader is to a file, not the live system. Additionally, the logged output of the upgrader should be used as a guide and reviewed.\nFor example, using:\n./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json --bican-user-network-name CAN --customer-access-network 6 10.103.11.128/25 --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns The log output for migration/converting the existing CAN to the new CMN looks like:\nConverting existing CAN network to CMN.

The order in which CAN subnets will be migrated to the CMN is: ['metallb_static_pool', 'metallb_address_pool', 'network_hardware', 'bootstrap_dhcp']. After each subnet is allocated the remaining subnets available (for the next step) are listed. E.g. Remaining subnets: ['10.103.11.0/27', '10.103.11.32/28', '10.103.11.48/29', '10.103.11.56/30']. The bootstrap_dhcp subnet (K8S NCNs) is large enough to create the NCNs but NOT large enough to create a DHCP pool effectively: WARNING: Insufficient IPv4 addresses to create DHCP ranges - 13 devices in a subnet supporting 14 devices. Technically the SLS file generated by this run will work, but a system or network administrator will likely need some pool of addresses in bootstrap_dhcp and this waring should be remediated.  Expert Mode: Overriding Defaults and Forced Guiding of Upgrades As might be observed from the above example, due to pre-uprade subnet sizes, or multiple constraints, the \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; input values might not be sufficient for some systems. This requires expert mode.\nExpert Mode Prerequisites  Knowledge of system and site network parameters (IPv4 addresses and subnets as well as VLANs). The ability to create subnets from a given network, or ability to read output subnet values, make an educated decision and modify upgrader input values for the next run. Slow down, be patient.  Expert Mode Process  Review the existing networks and subnets in the SLS input file. Make an educated guess about how sls_updater_csm_1.2.py should work and run the program. A typical first pass is to --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns. Review the logged output, noting warnings and errors as well as the location and size of subnets.  Copy the first entry in the log which says Creating subnets in the following order.  If --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns was used, remove the metallb_address_pool from the subnets list. If --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns was used, remove bootstrap_dhcp from the subnets list.   Copy the first entry in the log which says Remaining subnets. This provides the canonical list from which remaining subnets in the previous entry can be assigned IP addresses.   Add override command line values to override the upgrader\u0026rsquo;s default logic and pin subnet allocations for each network. This is a manual step, but is safe because the upgrader produced both the list of subnets and the subnet IPAM allocations. Users are simply assigning subnets from a fixed list and a pre-allocated list of IPv4 subnets. Re-run the upgrader with the new parameters. Repeat the process, if necessary.  Example For this example of expert mode a very common use case is used with the following requirements:\n The user network will be the CHN. The external-dns IP must be maintained to avoid operational changes to the site/customer network. The upgrade to CSM 1.2 will be a rolling upgrade, not a full outage. To prevent race conditions during the rolling upgrade with temporary IP overlaps, preservation of the K8S NCN IPs for CAN (CMN) are required.  The focus of the process that follows will be on the CMN IP allocations. The same process may be used for the CAN.\nProcess:\n Review of the existing SLS file for CAN shows that NCN addresses are in the range: 10.103.11.2 to 10.103.11.14 with a DHCP Pool above this. An educated first pass is to run the updater while preserving the external-dns IP only and look for the CMN output:  ./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CHN \\  --customer-highspeed-network 55 172.16.0.0/16 \\  --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns ...snip...

Remaining subnets: ['10.103.11.64/26', '10.103.11.0/27', '10.103.11.32/28', '10.103.11.48/29', '10.103.11.56/30']   The user task is to map named subnets into IP subnet ranges based on required and desired constraints and develop --cmn-subnet-override parameters from the mapping.  Another immediate constraint is to preserve NCN IP addresses for CAN as it\u0026rsquo;s transformed into the CMN. NCNs are in the boostrap_dhcp subnet and review of SLS data confirms that NCNs were previously in a range that fits into the new \u0026ldquo;Remaining subnet\u0026rdquo; of 10.103.11.0/27. Generally another desired constraint is to make the service IP pool allocated to metallb_address_pool as large as possible. After removing NCNs from the previous step, the next largest subnet is 10.103.11.64/26 and this will be assigned to metallb_address_pool. The best practice from at this point is to also manually pin the remaining subnets, here only network_hardware to provide a fully determinate override. This could be any remaining IP subnet from the list and for the example this becomes 10.103.11.32/28. Take a deep breath and assemble the new command line with overrides.   The next run of the upgrader for the example looks like:  ./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py \\  --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CHN \\  --customer-highspeed-network 55 172.16.0.0/16 \\  --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns \\  --cmn-subnet-override bootstrap_dhcp 10.103.11.0/27 \\  --cmn-subnet-override cmn_metallb_address_pool 10.103.11.64/26 \\  --cmn-subnet-override network_hardware 10.103.11.32/28 The next run completes successfully and the logs show the following CMN allocations:  Converting existing CAN network to CMN.

The focus has been on IP allocation of the CMN network. A very similar process can be used if the CAN network is desired (instead of a CHN).\nWARNING: During design and implementation of the SLS upgrader all attempts were made to safely and accurately migrate and update SLS data.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Upgrade SLS Offline from CSM 1.0.x to CSM 1.2 Abstract During the update of SLS,at a minimum, answers to the following questions must be known prior to upgrading:\n By default in 1.2 non-administrative user traffic will be migrated from the CAN to the CHN while minimizing changes. If you want it to continue to come in via the CAN, or if the site is Air-gapped, specify the correct options Will user traffic (non-administrative) come in via the CAN, CHN or is the site Air-gapped? What is the internal VLAN and the site-routable IP subnet for the new CAN or CHN? Is there a need to preserve any existing IP address(es) during the CAN-to-CMN migration?  One example would be the external-dns IP address used for DNS lookups of system resources from site DNS servers. Changes to external-dns often require changes to site resources with requisite pr ocess and timeframes from other groups. For preserving external-dns IP addresses, the flag is --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns. WARNING: It is up to the user to compare pre-upgraded and post-upgraded SLS files for sanity. Specifically, in the case of preserving external-dns values, to prevent site-networking changes that might result in NCN IP addresses overlapping during the upgrade process. This requires network subnetting expertise and EXPERT mode below. Another, mutually exclusive example is the need to preserve all NCN IP addresses related to the old CAN whilst migrating the new CMN. This preservation is not often needed as the transition of NCN IP addresses for the CAN-to-CMN is automatically handled during the upgrade. The flag to preserve CAN-to-CMN NCN IP addresses is mutually exclusive with other preservations and the flag is --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn ncns. Should no preservation flag be set, the default behavior is to recalculate every IP address on the existing CAN while migrating to the CMN. The behavior in this case is to calculate the subnet sizesbased on number of devices (with a bit of spare room), while maximizing IP address pool sizes for (dynamic) services.

MetalLB pools in the bootstrap_dhcp subnet will be shifted around to remain at the end of the new bootstrap subnet.\nCreate the CHN network With the original CAN as a template, the new CHN network will be created. IP addresses will come from the --customer-highspeed-network \u0026lt;vlan\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ipaddress\u0026gt; (or its defaults). This will be created all the time and can be removed (if not needed/desired) by using the --retain-unused-user-network flag.\nConvert the IP addresses of the CAN network Since the original/existing CAN has been converted to the new CMN, the CAN must have new IP addresses. These are provided via the --customer-access-network \u0026lt;vlan\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ipaddress\u0026gt; (or its defaults). This CAN conversion will happen all the time, but the new CAN may be removed (if not needed/desired) by using the --retain-unused-user-network flag.\nAdd BGP peering info to CMN and NMN MetalLB and switches now obtain BGP peers via SLS data.\n--bgp-asn INTEGER RANGE The autonomous system number for BGP router [default: 65533;64512\u0026lt;=x\u0026lt;=65534] --bgp-cmn-asn INTEGER RANGE The autonomous system number for CMN BGP clients [default: 65534;64512\u0026lt;=x\u0026lt;=65534] --bgp-nmn-asn INTEGER RANGE The autonomous system number for NMN BGP clients [default: 65533;64512\u0026lt;=x\u0026lt;=65534] In CMN and NMN:\n\u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ethernet\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ExtraProperties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;CIDR\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10.102.3.0/25\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MTU\u0026#34;: 9000, \u0026#34;MyASN\u0026#34;: 65536, \u0026#34;PeerASN\u0026#34;: 65533, \u0026#34;Subnets\u0026#34;: [ { Remove kubeapi-vip reservations for all networks except NMN Self explanatory. This endpoint now exists only on the NMN.\nUpdate uai_macvlan in NMN ranges and uai_macvlan VLAN Self explanatory. Ranges are used for the addresses of UAIs.\nRemove unused user networks (either CAN or CHN) if desired By default the CAN will be removed if --bican-user-network-name CHN or the CHN will be removed if --bican-user-network-name CAN. To keep this network use the --retain-unused-user-network flag. Retention of the unused network is not normal behavior.\n Generally production systems will NOT want to use this flag unless active toggling between CAN and CHN is required. This is not usual behavior. Test/development systems may want to have all networks for testing purposes and might want to retain both user networks.  "

When upgrading a system, this top-level README.md file should be followed top to bottom, and the content on this top level page is meant to be terse. See the additional files in the various directories under the resource_material directory for additional reference material in support of the processes/scripts mentioned explicitly on this page.\nAbstract For TDS systems with only three worker nodes, prior to proceeding with this upgrade CPU limits MUST be lowered on several services in order for this upgrade to succeed. This step is executed automatically as part of Stage 0.4 for more information.\nIndependently, the customizations.yaml file will be edited automatically during upgrade for TDS systems prior to deploying new CSM services. See the file: /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/upgrade/tds_cpu_requests.yaml for these settings.

Please see Restore Bare-Metal etcd Clusters from an S3 Snapshot for that procedure.\n  Back-ups for Etcd-Operator Clusters\nAfter upgrading, if health checks indicate that etcd pods are not in a healthy/running state, recovery procedures may be needed. Please see Backups for etcd-operator Clusters for these procedures.\n  Recovering from Postgres Database Issues\nAfter upgrading, if health checks indicate the Postgres pods are not in a healthy/running state, recovery procedures may be needed.

NCNs on install  Verify the DNSMASQ configuration file matches what is configured on the switches.  Here is a DNSMASQ configuration file for the Metal network (VLAN1). As you can see, the router IP address is 10.1.0.1. This has to match what the IP address is on the switches doing the routing for the MTL network. This is most commonly on the spines. This configuration is commonly missed on the CSI input file.

Verify DHCP packets can be forwarded from the workers to the MTL network (VLAN1)  If the Worker nodes cannot reach the metal network DHCP will fail.

Verify route to TFTP  On BOTH Aruba switches we need a single route to the TFTP server 10.92.100.60. This is needed because there are issues with Aruba ECMP hashing and TFTP traffic.  sw-spine-002# show ip route 10.92.100.60 Displaying ipv4 routes selected for forwarding '[x/y]' denotes [distance/metric] 10.92.100.60/32, vrf default, tag 0 via 10.252.1.9, [70/0], bgp  This route can be a static route or a BGP route that is pinned to a single worker. (1.4.2 patch introduces the BGP pinned route) Verify that you can ping the next hop of this route. For the example above we would ping 10.252.1.9. If this is not reachable this is your problem.  2.4. Test TFTP traffic (Aruba Only)  You can test the TFTP traffic by trying to download the ipxe.efi binary. Log into the leaf switch and try to download the iPXE binary. This requires that the leaf switch can talk to the TFTP server \u0026ldquo;10.92.100.60\u0026rdquo;  sw-leaf-001# start-shell sw-leaf-001:~$ sudo su sw-leaf-001:/home/admin# tftp 10.92.100. tftp\u0026gt; get ipxe.efi Received 1007200 bytes in 2.2 seconds tftp\u0026gt; get ipxe.efi Received 1007200 bytes in 2.2 seconds tftp\u0026gt; get ipxe.efi Received 1007200 bytes in 2.2 seconds  You can see here that the ipxe.efi binary is downloaded three times in a row. When we have seen issues with ECMP hashing this would fail intermittently.  2.5. Check DHCP lease is getting allocated  Check the KEA logs and verify that the lease is getting allocated.  ncn# kubectl logs -n services pod/$(kubectl get -n services pods | grep kea | head -n1 | cut -f 1 -d \u0026#39; \u0026#39;) -c cray-dhcp-kea 2021-04-21 00:13:05.416 INFO [kea-dhcp4.leases/24.139710796402304] DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC [hwtype=1 02:23:28:01:30:10], cid=[00:78:39:30:30:30:63:31:73:30:62:31], tid=0x21f2433a: lease 10.104.0.23 has been allocated for 300 seconds  Here we can see that KEA is allocating a lease to 10.104.0.23. The lease MUST say DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC. If it says DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT, there is likely a problem. Restarting KEA will fix this issue most of the time.  2021-06-21 16:44:31.124 INFO [kea-dhcp4.leases/18.139837089017472] DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT [hwtype=1 14:02:ec:d9:79:88], cid=[no info], tid=0xe87fad10: lease 10.252.1.16 will be advertised 2.6. Verify the DHCP traffic on the Workers  We have ran into issues on HPE servers and Aruba switches where the source address of the DHCP Offer is the Metallb address of KEA 10.92.100.222. The source address of the DHCP Reply/Offer needs to be the address of the VLAN interface on the Worker. Here is how to look at DHCP traffic on the workers.  ncn-w# tcpdump -envli bond0 port 67 or 68  You are looking for the source IP address of the DHCP Reply/Offer.  10.252.1.9.67 \u0026gt; 255.255.255.255.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 309, hops 1, xid 0x98b0982e, Flags [Broadcast] Your-IP 10.252.1.17 Server-IP 10.92.100.60 Gateway-IP 10.252.0.1 Client-Ethernet-Address 14:02:ec:d9:79:88 file \u0026quot;ipxe.efi\u0026quot;[|bootp]  If the Source IP address of the DHCP Reply/Offer is the MetalLB IP address, the DHCP packet will never make it out of the NCN. An example of this is below.  10.92.100.222.116 \u0026gt; 255.255.255.255.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 309, hops 1, xid 0x260ea655, Flags [Broadcast] Your-IP 10.252.1.14 Server-IP 10.92.100.60 Gateway-IP 10.252.0.4 Client-Ethernet-Address 14:02:ec:d9:79:88 file \u0026quot;ipxe.efi\u0026quot;[|bootp]  If you run into this, the only solution that we have found so far is restarting KEA and making sure that it gets moved to a different worker. We believe this has something to do with conntrack.  2.7. Verify the switches are forwarding DHCP traffic.  If you still cannot PXE boot, the IP-Helper may be breaking on the switch. On Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox switches we have seen the IP-Helpers get stuck and stop forwarding DHCP traffic to the client.  The solutions vary from vendor to vendor. On an Aruba or Mellanox switch, delete the entire VLAN configuration and re-apply it, in order for the DHCP traffic to come back. On a Dell switch, do a reboot in order to restore DHCP traffic.   The underlying cause of IP-Helper breaking is not yet known.  3. Compute Nodes/UANs/Application Nodes  The following are required for compute node PXE booting.  Verify BGP\n Verify route to TFTP Test TFTP traffic Check DHCP lease is getting allocated Verify the DHCP traffic on the Workers Verify the switches are forwarding DHCP traffic   Verify the IP-Helpers on the VLAN the computes nodes are booting over. This is typically VLAN 2 or VLAN 2xxx (MTN Computes) If the compute nodes make it past PXE and go into the PXE shell you can verify DNS and connectivity.  iPXE\u0026gt; dhcp Configuring (net0 98:03:9b:a8:60:88)..................

	"content": "Stage 0 - Prerequisites and Preflight Checks  Note: CSM-1.0.1 or higher is required in order to upgrade to CSM-1.2.0\n Abstract Stage 0 has several critical procedures which prepares and verify if the environment is ready for upgrade. First, the latest docs RPM is installed; it includes critical install scripts used in the upgrade procedure. Next, the current configuration of the System Layout Service (SLS) is updated to have necessary information for CSM 1.2. The management network configuration is also upgraded. Towards the end, prerequisite checks are performed to ensure that the upgrade is ready to proceed. Finally, a backup of Workload Manager configuration data and files is created. Once complete, the upgrade proceeds to Stage 1.\nStages\n Stage 0.1 - Install latest docs RPM Stage 0.2 - Update SLS Stage 0.3 - Upgrade Management Network Stage 0.4 - Prerequisites Check Stage 0.5 - Backup Workload Manager Data Stage Completed  Stage 0.1 - Install latest documentation RPM   Install latest documentation RPM package and prepare assets:\n The install scripts will look for the RPM in /root, so it is important that you copy it there.\n ncn-m001# CSM_RELEASE=csm-1.2.0   Internet Connected\n  Set the ENDPOINT variable to the URL of the directory containing the CSM release tarball.\nIn other words, the full URL to the CSM release tarball will be ${ENDPOINT}${CSM_RELEASE}.tar.gz\nNote: This step is optional for Cray/HPE internal installs.\nncn-m001# ENDPOINT=https://put.the/url/here/   Run the script\nncn-m001# wget https://artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/csm-rpms/hpe/stable/sle-15sp2/docs-csm/1.2/noarch/docs-csm-latest.noarch.rpm -P /root \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rpm -Uvh --force /root/docs-csm-latest.noarch.rpm ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/upgrade/prepare-assets.sh --csm-version [CSM_RELEASE] --endpoint [ENDPOINT]     Air Gapped (replace the PATH_TO below with the location of the rpm)\n  Copy the docs-csm RPM package and CSM release tarball to ncn-m001.\n  Run the script\nncn-m001# cp [PATH_TO_docs-csm-*.noarch.rpm] /root ncn-m001# rpm -Uvh --force /root/docs-csm-*.noarch.rpm ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/upgrade/prepare-assets.sh --csm-version [CSM_RELEASE] --tarball-file [PATH_TO_CSM_TARBALL_FILE]       Stage 0.2 - Update SLS Abstract CSM 1.2 introduces the bifurcated CAN as well as network configuration controlled by data in SLS. An offline upgrade of SLS data is performed. More details on the upgrade and its sequence of events can be found in the README.SLS_upgrade.md.\nThe SLS data upgrade is a critical step in moving to CSM 1.2. Upgraded SLS data is used in DNS and management network configuration. Details of Bifurcated CAN can be found in the BICAN document to aid in understanding and decision-making.\nOne detail which must not be overlooked is that the existing Customer Access Network (CAN) will be migrated or retrofitted into the new Customer Management Network (CMN) while minimizing changes. A new CAN, (or CHN) network is then created. Pivoting the existing CAN to the new CMN allows administrative traffic (already on the CAN) to remain as-is while moving standard user traffic to a new site-routable network.\n Important: If this is the first time performing the SLS update to CSM 1.2, you should review the README.SLS_upgrade.md to ensure you use all the correct options for your environment. Two examples are given below. To see all options from the update script run ./sls_updater_csm_1.2.py --help\n Retrieve SLS data as JSON   Obtain a token:\nncn-m001# export TOKEN=$(curl -s -k -S -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id=admin-client \\  -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.client-secret}\u0026#39; | base64 -d` \\  https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r \u0026#39;.access_token\u0026#39;)   Create a working directory:\nncn-m001# mkdir /root/sls_upgrade ncn-m001# cd /root/sls_upgrade   Extract SLS data to a file:\nncn-m001# curl -k -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/sls/v1/dumpstate | jq -S . \u0026gt; sls_input_file.json   Migrate SLS data JSON to CSM 1.2   Example 1: The CHN as the system default route (will by default output to migrated_sls_file.json).\nncn-m001# export DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/sls ncn-m001# ${DOCDIR}/sls_updater_csm_1.2.py --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CHN \\  --customer-highspeed-network 5 10.103.11.192/26   Example 2: The CAN as the system default route, keep the generated CHN (for testing), and preserve the existing external-dns entry.\nncn-m001# export DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/sls ncn-m001# ${DOCDIR}/sls_updater_csm_1.2.py --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \\  --bican-user-network-name CAN \\  --customer-access-network 6 10.103.15.192/26 \\  --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns   Note:: A detailed review of the migrated/upgraded data (using vimdiff or otherwise) for production systems and for systems which have many add-on components (UAN, login nodes, storage integration points, etc.) is strongly recommended. Particularly, ensure that subnet reservations are correct in order to prevent any data mismatches.\n  Upload migrated SLS file to SLS service ncn-m001# curl -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\u0026#34; -k -L -X POST \u0026#39;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/sls/v1/loadstate\u0026#39; -F \u0026#39;sls_dump=@migrated_sls_file.json\u0026#39; Stage 0.3 - Upgrade Management Network Verify if switches have 1.2 configuration in place   Log in to each management switch\nlinux# ssh admin@1.2.3.4   Examine the text displayed when logging in to the switch. Specifically, look for output similar to the following:\n################################################################################## # CSM version: 1.2 # CANU version: 1.3.2 ##################################################################################   If you see text like the above, then it means that the switches have a CANU-generated configuration for CSM 1.2 in place. In this case, follow the steps in the Management Network 1.0 (1.2 Preconfig) to 1.2.\n  If the banner does NOT contain text like the above, then contact support in order to get the 1.2 preconfigs applied to the system.\n  See the Management Network User Guide for more information on the management network.\n    Stage 0.4 - Prerequisites Check   Set the SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable.\nSet it to the password for admin user on the switches.

Refer to HPE PDU Admin Procedures for additional configuration for this type of PDU. The steps to run will depend on if the PDU has been set up yet, and whether or not an upgrade or fresh install of CSM is being performed.\nChildVerificationFailed Check the SMD logs to determine the cause of the bad Redfish path encountered during discovery.\n# get the SMD pod names ncn # kubectl -n services get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-smd NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cray-smd-5b9d574756-9b2lj 2/2 Running 0 24d cray-smd-5b9d574756-bnztf 2/2 Running 0 24d cray-smd-5b9d574756-hhc5p 2/2 Running 0 24d # get the logs from each of the SMD pods ncn# kubectl -n services logs \u0026lt;cray-smd-pod1\u0026gt; cray-smd \u0026gt; smd_pod1_logs ncn# kubectl -n services logs \u0026lt;cray-smd-pod2\u0026gt; cray-smd \u0026gt; smd_pod2_logs ncn# kubectl -n services logs \u0026lt;cray-smd-pod3\u0026gt; cray-smd \u0026gt; smd_pod3_logs DiscoveryStarted The endpoint is in the process of being inventoried by Hardware State Manager (HSM).

	"content": "Troubleshoot the CMS Barebones Image Boot Test Verify that the CSM services needed to boot a node are available and working properly. This section describes how the barebonesImageTest script works and how to interpret the results. If the script is unavailable, the manual steps for reproducing the barebones image boot test are provided.\nTopics  1. Steps the Script Performs 2. Controlling Which Node Is Used 3. Controlling Output 4. Manual Steps  4.1 Locate CSM Barebones Image in IMS 4.2 Create a BOS Session Template for the CSM Barebones Image 4.3 Find an available compute node 4.4 Reboot the node using a BOS session template 4.5 Connect to the node\u0026rsquo;s console and watch the boot    1. Steps the Script Performs The script file is: /opt/cray/tests/integration/csm/barebonesImageTest\nThis script automates the following steps.\n Obtain the Kubernetes API gateway access token Find the existing barebones boot image using IMS Create a BOS session template for the barebones boot image Find an enabled compute node using HSM Watch the console log for the target compute node using console services Create a BOS session to reboot the target compute node Wait for the console output to show an error or successfully reach dracut  If the script fails, investigate the underlying service to ensure it is operating correctly and examine the detailed log file to find information on the exact error and cause of failure.\nThe boot may take up to 10 or 15 minutes. The image being booted does not support a complete boot, so the node will not boot fully into an operating system. This test is merely to verify that the CSM services needed to boot a node are available and working properly. This boot test is considered successful if the boot reaches the dracut stage.\n2. Controlling Which Node Is Used By default, the script will gather all enabled compute nodes that are present in HSM and choose one at random to perform the boot test. This may be overridden with a command line option to choose which compute node is rebooted using the --xname option. The input compute node must be enabled and present in HSM to be used. If the input compute node is not available, a warning will be issued and the test will continue with a valid compute node instead of the user selected node.\nncn# /opt/cray/tests/integration/csm/barebonesImageTest --xname x3000c0s10b1n0 3. Controlling Test Script Output Level Output is directed to both the console calling the script as well as a log file that will hold more detailed information on the run and any potential problems found. The log file is written to /tmp/cray.barebones-boot-test.log and will overwrite any existing file at that location on each new run of the script.\nThe messages output to the console and the log file may be controlled separately through environment variables. To control the information being sent to the console, set the variable CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL. To control the information being sent to the log file, set the variable FILE_LOG_LEVEL. Valid values in increasing levels of detail are: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG. The default for the console output is INFO and the default for the log file is DEBUG.\nHere is an example of running the script with more information displayed on the console during the execution of the test:\nncn# CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG /opt/cray/tests/integration/csm/barebonesImageTest cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Barebones image boot test starting cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO For complete logs look in the file /tmp/cray.barebones-boot-test.log cray.barebones-boot-test: DEBUG Found boot image: cray-shasta-csm-sles15sp2-barebones.x86_64-shasta-1.5 cray.barebones-boot-test: DEBUG Creating bos session template with etag:bc390772fbe67107cd58b3c7c08ed92d, path:s3://boot-images/e360fae1-7926-4dee-85bb-f2b4eb216d9c/manifest.json 4.

Utility storage is a cost-effective solution for storing the large amounts of telemetry and log data collected.\nCeph is the utility storage platform that is used to enable pods to store persistent data.

Those nodes are the only ones with the necessary credentials. Individual procedures will specify when to run a command from a node other than those.  Key Concepts  Shrink: This only pertains to removing nodes from a cluster. Since Octopus and the move to utilize Ceph orchestrator, the Ceph cluster is probing nodes and adding unused drives. Removing a drive will only work if the actual drive is removed from a server. Add: This will most commonly pertain to adding a node with its full allotment of drives.

	"content": "Validate CSM Health Anytime after the installation of the CSM services, the health of the management nodes and all CSM services can be validated.\nThe following are examples of when to run health checks:\n After completing the Install CSM Services Before and after NCN reboots After the system is brought back up Any time there is unexpected behavior observed In order to provide relevant information to create support tickets  The areas should be tested in the order they are listed on this page. Errors in an earlier check may cause errors in later checks because of dependencies.\nTopics:  Validate CSM Health  Topics: 0. Cray Command Line Interface 1.

Cray Command Line Interface The first time these checks are performed during a CSM install, the Cray Command Line Interface (CLI) has not yet been configured. Some of the health check tests cannot be run without the Cray CLI being configured. Tests with this dependency are noted in their descriptions below. These tests may be skipped but this is not recommended.\nThe Cray CLI must be configured on all NCNs and the PIT node. The following procedures explain how to do this:\n Configure Keycloak Account Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (CLI)  1. Platform Health Checks All platform health checks are expected to pass. Each check has been implemented as a Goss test which reports a PASS or FAIL.\nAvailable Platform Health Checks:\n ncnHealthChecks OPTIONAL Check of ncnHealthChecks Resources Check of System Management Monitoring Tools  1.1 NCN Health Checks These checks require that the Cray CLI is configured on all worker NCNs.\nIf ncn-m001 is the PIT node, run these checks on ncn-m001, otherwise run them from any NCN.\nThere are multiple Goss test suites available that cover a variety of subsystems. The platform health checks are defined in the test suites ncn-healthcheck and ncn-kubernetes-checks.\n  Specify the admin user password for the management switches in the system, which is required for the ncn-healthcheck test.\nncn/pit# export SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD=\u0026#39;changeme\u0026#39;   Run the NCN health checks.\nncn/pit# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-healthcheck   Run the Kubernetes checks.\nncn/pit# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-kubernetes-checks   Review results.\nReview the output for Result: FAIL and follow the instructions provided to resolve any such test failures. With the exception of the Known Test Issues, all health checks are expected to pass.\n  1.1.1 Known Test Issues  It is possible that the first pass of running these tests may fail due to could-init not being completed on the storage nodes. In this case please wait 5 minutes and re-run the tests. Kubernetes Query BSS Cloud-init for ca-certs  This test may fail immediately after platform install. It should pass after the TrustedCerts Operator has updated BSS (Global cloud-init meta) with CA certificates.   Kubernetes Velero No Failed Backups  Because of a known issue with Velero, a backup may be attempted immediately upon the deployment of a backup schedule (for example, vault). It may be necessary to delete backups from a Kubernetes node to clear this situation. See the output of the test for more details on how to cleanup backups that have failed due to a known interruption. For example:  Run the following to find the failed backup. ncn/pit# kubectl get backups -A -o json | jq -e \u0026#39;.items[] | select(.status.phase == \u0026#34;PartiallyFailed\u0026#34;) | .metadata.name\u0026#39;  Delete the backup, where \u0026lt;backup\u0026gt; is replaced with a backup returned in the previous step. ncn# velero backup delete \u0026lt;backup\u0026gt; --confirm      Verify spire-agent is enabled and running  The spire-agent service may fail to start on Kubernetes NCNs (all worker nodes and master nodes), logging errors (via journalctl) similar to \u0026ldquo;join token does not exist or has already been used\u0026rdquo; or the last logs containing multiple lines of \u0026ldquo;systemd[1]: spire-agent.service: Start request repeated too quickly.\u0026rdquo;. Deleting the request-ncn-join-token daemonset pod running on the node may clear the issue. Even though the spire-agent systemctl service on the Kubernetes node should eventually restart cleanly, the user may have to log in to the impacted nodes and restart the service. The following recovery procedure can be run from any Kubernetes node in the cluster.  Define the following function ncn/pit# function renewncnjoin() { for pod in $(kubectl get pods -n spire |grep request-ncn-join-token | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39;); do if kubectl describe -n spire pods $pod | grep -q \u0026#34;Node:.*$1\u0026#34;; then echo \u0026#34;Restarting $podrunning on $1\u0026#34; kubectl delete -n spire pod \u0026#34;$pod\u0026#34; fi done }  Run the function as follows (substituting the name of the impacted NCN): ncn/pit# renewncnjoin ncn-xxxx    The spire-agent service may also fail if an NCN was powered off for too long and its tokens expired. If this happens, delete /root/spire/agent_svid.der, /root/spire/bundle.der, and /root/spire/data/svid.key off the NCN before deleting the request-ncn-join-token daemonset pod.   cfs-state-reporter errors on storage nodes  If the cfs-state-reporter check is failing on one or more storage nodes, it could be an issue with their spire tokens. The following procedure may resolve the problem:  Run the following script on ncn-m002: ncn-m002# /opt/cray/platform-utils/spire/fix-spire-on-storage.sh  Then re-run the check to see if the problem has been resolved.      1.2 NCN Resource Checks (optional) To dump the NCN uptimes, the node resource consumptions, and/or the list of pods not in a running state, run the following:\nncn/pit# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s ncn_uptimes ncn/pit# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s node_resource_consumption ncn/pit# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s pods_not_running 1.2.1 Known Issues  pods_not_running   If the output of pods_not_running indicates that there are pods in the Evicted state, it may be due to the root file system being filled up on the Kubernetes node in question. Kubernetes will begin evicting pods once the root file system space is at 85% full until it is back under 80%. This commonly happens on ncn-m001, because it is a location where install and documentation files may have been downloaded. It may be necessary to clean up space in the / directory if this is the root cause of pod evictions. Listing the top 10 files that are 1024M or larger is one way to start the analysis.\nncn# df -h / Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on LiveOS_rootfs 280G 245G 35G 88% / ncn# du -h -s /root/ 225G /root/ ncn# du -ah -B 1024M /root | sort -n -r | head -n 10   The cray-crus- pod is expected to be in the Init state until Slurm and MUNGE are installed. In particular, this will be the case if executing this as part of the validation after completing the Install CSM Services. If in doubt, validate the CRUS service using the CMS Validation Tool. If the CRUS check passes using that tool, do not worry about the cray-crus- pod state.\n  The hmn-discovery and cray-dns-unbound-manager cronjob pods may be in a \u0026lsquo;NotReady\u0026rsquo; state. This is expected as these pods are periodically started and transition to the completed state.\n    1.3 Check of System Management Monitoring Tools If all designated prerequisites are met, the availability of system management health services may optionally be validated by accessing the URLs listed in Access System Management Health Services. It is very important to check the Prerequisites section of this document.\nIf one or more of the the URLs listed in the procedure are inaccessible, it does not necessarily mean that system is not healthy. It may simply mean that not all of the prerequisites have been met to allow access to the system management health tools via URL.\nInformation to assist with troubleshooting some of the components mentioned in the prerequisites can be accessed here:\n Troubleshoot CAN Issues Troubleshoot DNS Configuration Issues Check BGP Status and Reset Sessions Troubleshoot BGP not Accepting Routes from MetalLB Troubleshoot Services without an Allocated IP Address Troubleshoot Prometheus Alerts  2. Hardware Management Services Health Checks The checks in this section require that the Cray CLI is configured on nodes where the checks are executed.\nExecute the HMS tests to confirm that the Hardware Management Services are running and operational.\nNote: Do not run HMS tests concurrently on multiple nodes. They may interfere with one another and cause false failures.\n2.1 HMS CT Test Execution These tests may be executed on any one worker or master NCN (but not ncn-m001 if it is still the PIT node).\nRun the HMS CT tests. This is done by running the run_hms_ct_tests.sh script:\nncn# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/run_hms_ct_tests.sh The return value of the script is 0 if all CT tests ran successfully, non-zero if not. On CT test failures the script will instruct the admin to look at the CT test log files. If one or more failures occur, investigate the cause of each failure. See the interpreting_hms_health_check_results documentation for more information.\n2.2 Hardware State Manager Discovery Validation By this point in the installation process, the Hardware State Manager (HSM) should have done its discovery of the system.\nThe foundational information for this discovery is from the System Layout Service (SLS). Thus, a comparison needs to be done to see that what is specified in SLS (focusing on BMC components and Redfish endpoints) are present in HSM.\nTo perform this comparison execute the verify_hsm_discovery.py script on a Kubernetes master or worker NCN. The result is pass/fail (returns 0 or non-zero):\nncn# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/verify_hsm_discovery.py The output will ideally appear as follows, if there are mismatches these will be displayed in the appropriate section of the output. Refer to 2.3.1 Interpreting results and 2.2.2 Known Issues below to troubleshoot any mismatched BMCs.\nHSM Cabinet Summary =================== x1000 (Mountain) Discovered Nodes: 50 Discovered Node BMCs: 25 Discovered Router BMCs: 32 Discovered Chassis BMCs: 8 x3000 (River) Discovered Nodes: 23 (12 Mgmt, 7 Application, 4 Compute) Discovered Node BMCs: 24 Discovered Router BMCs: 2 Discovered Cab PDU Ctlrs: 0 River Cabinet Checks ==================== x3000 Nodes: PASS NodeBMCs: PASS RouterBMCs: PASS ChassisBMCs: PASS CabinetPDUControllers: PASS Mountain/Hill Cabinet Checks ============================ x1000 (Mountain) ChassisBMCs: PASS Nodes: PASS NodeBMCs: PASS RouterBMCs: PASS The script will have an exit code of 0 if there are no failures. If there is any FAIL information displayed, the script will exit with a non-zero exit code. Failure information interpretation is described in the next section.\n2.2.1 Interpreting results The Cabinet Checks output is divided into three sections:\n Summary information for for each cabinet Detail information for for River cabinets Detail information for Mountain/Hill cabinets.  In the River section, any hardware found in SLS and not discovered by HSM is considered a failure, with the exception of PDU controllers, which is a warning. Also, the BMC of one of the management NCNs (typically ncn-m001) will not be connected to the HSM HW network and thus will show up as being not discovered and/or not having any mgmt network connection. This is treated as a warning.\nIn the Mountain section, the only thing considered a failure are Chassis BMCs that are not discovered in HSM. All other items (nodes, node BMCs and router BMCs) which are not discovered are considered warnings.\nAny failures need to be investigated by the admin for rectification. Any warnings should also be examined by the administrator to ensure they are accurate and expected.\nFor each of the BMCs that show up as not being present in HSM components or Redfish Endpoints use the following notes to determine whether the issue with the BMC can be safely ignored or needs to be addressed before proceeding.\n  The node BMC of ncn-m001 will not typically be present in HSM component data, as it is typically connected to the site network instead of the HMN network.\n  The node BMCs for HPE Apollo XL645D nodes may report as a mismatch depending on the state of the system when the hsm_discovery_verify.sh script is run. If the system is currently going through the process of installation, then this is an expected mismatch as the Prepare Compute Nodes procedure required to configure the BMC of the HPE Apollo 6500 XL645D node may not have been completed yet.\n For more information refer to Configure HPE Apollo 6500 XL645d Gen10 Plus Compute Nodes for additional required configuration for this type of BMC.\n Example mismatch for the BMC of an HPE Apollo XL654D:\n... Nodes: FAIL - x3000c0s30b1n0 (Compute, NID 5) - Not found in HSM Components. NodeBMCs: FAIL - x3000c0s19b1 - Not found in HSM Components; Not found in HSM Redfish Endpoints. ...   Chassis Management Controllers (CMC) may show up as not being present in HSM. CMCs for Intel node blades can be ignored. Gigabyte node blade CMCs not found in HSM is not normal and should be investigated. If a Gigabyte CMC is expected to not be connected to the HMN network, then it can be ignored. Otherwise, verify that the root service account is configured for the CMC and add it if needed by following the steps outlined in Add Root Service Account for Gigabyte Controllers.\n CMCs have component names (xnames) in the form of xXc0sSb999, where X is the cabinet and S is the rack U of the compute node chassis.\n Example mismatch for a CMC an Intel node blade:\n  ... ChassisBMCs/CMCs: FAIL - x3000c0s10b999 - Not found in HSM Components; Not found in HSM Redfish Endpoints; No mgmt port connection. ...   HPE PDUs are supported and should show up as being found in HSM. If they are not, they should be investigated since that may indicate that configuration steps have not yet been executed which are required for the PDUs to be discovered. Refer to HPE PDU Admin Procedures for additional configuration for this type of PDU. The steps to run will depend on if the PDU has been set up yet, and whether or not an upgrade or fresh install of CSM is being performed.\n Cabinet PDU Controllers have component names (xnames) in the form of xXmM, where X is the cabinet and M is the ordinal of the Cabinet PDU Controller.\n Example mismatch for HPE PDU:\n  ... CabinetPDUControllers: WARNING - x3000m0 - Not found in HSM Components ; Not found in HSM Redfish Endpoints ...   BMCs having no association with a management switch port will be annotated as such, and should be investigated. Exceptions to this are in Mountain or Hill configurations where Mountain BMCs will show this condition on SLS/HSM mismatches, which is normal.\n  In Hill configurations SLS assumes BMCs in chassis 1 and 3 are fully populated (32 Node BMCs), and in Mountain configurations SLS assumes all BMCs are fully populated (128 Node BMCs). Any non-populated BMCs will have no HSM data and will show up in the mismatch list.\n  If it was determined that the mismatch can not be ignored, then proceed onto the the 2.3.2 Known Issues below to troubleshoot any mismatched BMCs.\n2.2.2 Known Issues Known issues that may prevent hardware from getting discovered by Hardware State Manager:\n HMS Discovery job not creating RedfishEndpoints in Hardware State Manager  3 Software Management Services Health Checks The Software Management Services health checks are run using /usr/local/bin/cmsdev.\n The tool logs to /opt/cray/tests/cmsdev.log The -q (quiet) and -v (verbose) flags can be used to decrease or increase the amount of information sent to the screen.  The same amount of data is written to the log file in either case.     SMS Test Execution Interpreting cmsdev Results  3.1 SMS Test Execution The test in this section requires that the Cray CLI is configured on nodes where the test is executed.\nThe following test can be run on any Kubernetes node (any master or worker node, but not the PIT node).\nncn# /usr/local/bin/cmsdev test -q all 3.2 Interpreting cmsdev Results If all checks passed:\n The return code will be 0 The final line of output will begin with SUCCESS For example: ncn# /usr/local/bin/cmsdev test -q all ... SUCCESS: All 7 service tests passed: bos, cfs, conman, crus, ims, tftp, vcs ncn# echo $? 0   If one or more checks failed:\n The return code will be non-0 The final line of output will begin with FAILURE and will list which checks failed For example: ncn# /usr/local/bin/cmsdev test -q all ... FAILURE: 2 service tests FAILED (conman, ims), 5 passed (bos, cfs, crus, tftp, vcs) ncn# echo $? 1   Additional test execution details can be found in /opt/cray/tests/cmsdev.log.\n4. Booting CSM Barebones Image Included with the Cray System Management (CSM) release is a pre-built node image that can be used to validate that core CSM services are available and responding as expected. The CSM barebones image contains only the minimal set of RPMs and configuration required to boot an image and is not suitable for production usage. To run production work loads, it is suggested that an image from the Cray OS (COS) product, or similar, be used.\n NOTES\n This test is very important to run during the CSM install prior to redeploying the PIT node because it validates all of the services required for that operation. The CSM Barebones image included with the release will not successfully complete beyond the dracut stage of the boot process. However, if the dracut stage is reached, the boot can be considered successful and shows that the necessary CSM services needed to boot a node are up and available.  This inability to boot the barebones image fully will be resolved in future releases of the CSM product.   In addition to the CSM Barebones image, the release also includes an IMS Recipe that can be used to build the CSM Barebones image. However, the CSM Barebones recipe currently requires RPMs that are not installed with the CSM product. The CSM Barebones recipe can be built after the Cray OS (COS) product stream is also installed on to the system.  In future releases of the CSM product, work will be undertaken to resolve these dependency issues.   This procedure can be followed on any NCN or the PIT node. This script uses the Kubernetes API Gateway to access CSM services. This gateway must be properly configured to allow an access token to be generated by the script. This script is installed as part of the \u0026lsquo;cray-cmstools-crayctldeploy\u0026rsquo; RPM. For additional information on the script and for troubleshooting help look at the document Barebones Image Boot.    Running the script  4.1 Run the Test Script The script is executable and can be run without any arguments. It returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure.\nncn# /opt/cray/tests/integration/csm/barebonesImageTest A successful run would generate output like the following:\ncray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Barebones image boot test starting cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO For complete logs look in the file /tmp/cray.barebones-boot-test.log cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Creating bos session with template:csm-barebones-image-test, on node:x3000c0s10b1n0 cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Starting boot on compute node: x3000c0s10b1n0 cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Found dracut message in console output - success!!! cray.barebones-boot-test: INFO Successfully completed barebones image boot test. The script will choose an enabled compute node that is listed in the Hardware State Manager (HSM) for the test unless the user passes in a specific node using the --xname argument. If a compute node is specified but unavailable, an available node will be used instead and a warning will be logged.\nncn# /opt/cray/tests/integration/csm/barebonesImageTest --xname x3000c0s10b4n0 5. UAS / UAI Tests The commands in this section require that the Cray CLI is configured on nodes where the commands are being executed.\nThe procedures below use the CLI as an authorized user and run on two separate node types. The first part runs on the LiveCD node, while the second part runs on a non-LiveCD Kubernetes master or worker node. When using the CLI on either node, the CLI configuration needs to be initialized and the user running the procedure needs to be authorized.\nThe following procedures run on separate nodes of the system.\n Validate Basic UAS Installation Validate UAI Creation UAS/UAI Troubleshooting  Authorization Issues UAS Cannot Access Keycloak UAI Images not in Registry Missing Volumes and Other Container Startup Issues    5.1 Validate the Basic UAS Installation This section can be run on any NCN or the PIT node.\n  Basic UAS installation is validated using the following: 1.\nncn# cray uas mgr-info list Expected output looks similar to the following:\nservice_name = \u0026#34;cray-uas-mgr\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;1.11.5\u0026#34; In this example output, it shows that UAS is installed and running the 1.11.5 version. 1.\nncn# cray uas list Expected output looks similar to the following:\nresults = [] This example output shows that there are no currently running UAIs. It is possible, if someone else has been using the UAS, that there could be UAIs in the list. That is acceptable too from a validation standpoint.\n  Verify that the pre-made UAI images are registered with UAS\nncn# cray uas images list Expected output looks similar to the following:\ndefault_image = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11\u0026#34; image_list = [ \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11\u0026#34;,] This example output shows that the pre-made end-user UAI image (cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11) is registered with UAS. This does not necessarily mean this image is installed in the container image registry, but it is configured for use. If other UAI images have been created and registered, they may also show up here, which is acceptable.\n  5.2 Validate UAI Creation  IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading CSM and your site does not use UAIs, skip UAS and UAI validation. If you do use UAIs, there are products that configure UAS like Cray Analytics and Cray Programming Environment. These must be working correctly with UAIs and should be validated and corrected (the procedures for this are beyond the scope of this document) prior to validating UAS and UAI. Failures in UAI creation that result from incorrect or incomplete installation of these products will generally take the form of UAIs stuck in \u0026lsquo;waiting\u0026rsquo; state trying to set up volume mounts. See the UAI Troubleshooting section for more information.\n This procedure must run on a master or worker node (not the PIT node and not ncn-w001) on the system.\n  Verify that a UAI can be created:\nncn# cray uas create --publickey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Expected output looks similar to the following:\nuai_connect_string = \u0026#34;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_host = \u0026#34;ncn-w001\u0026#34; uai_img = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11\u0026#34; uai_ip = \u0026#34;10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_msg = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; uai_name = \u0026#34;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026#34; uai_status = \u0026#34;Pending\u0026#34; username = \u0026#34;vers\u0026#34; [uai_portmap] This has created the UAI and the UAI is currently in the process of initializing and running.\n  Set UAINAME to the value of the uai_name field in the previous command output (uai-vers-a00fb46b in our example):\nncn# UAINAME=uai-vers-a00fb46b   Check the current status of the UAI:\nncn# cray uas list Expected output looks similar to the following:\n[[results]] uai_age = \u0026#34;0m\u0026#34; uai_connect_string = \u0026#34;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_host = \u0026#34;ncn-w001\u0026#34; uai_img = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11\u0026#34; uai_ip = \u0026#34;10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_msg = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; uai_name = \u0026#34;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026#34; uai_status = \u0026#34;Running: Ready\u0026#34; username = \u0026#34;vers\u0026#34; If the uai_status field is Running: Ready, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, wait and repeat this command until that is the case. It normally should not take more than a minute or two.\n  The UAI is ready for use. Log into it with the command in the uai_connect_string field in the previous command output:\nncn# ssh vers@10.16.234.10 vers@uai-vers-a00fb46b-6889b666db-4dfvn:~\u0026gt;   Run a command on the UAI:\nvers@uai-vers-a00fb46b-6889b666db-4dfvn:~\u0026gt; ps -afe Expected output looks similar to the following:\nUID PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME CMD root 1 0 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/bin/uai-ssh.sh munge 36 1 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 /usr/sbin/munged root 54 1 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 su vers -c /usr/sbin/sshd -e -f /etc/uas/ssh/sshd_config -D vers 55 54 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -e -f /etc/uas/ssh/sshd_config -D vers 62 55 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 sshd: vers [priv] vers 67 62 0 18:51 ? 00:00:00 sshd: vers@pts/0 vers 68 67 0 18:51 pts/0 00:00:00 -bash vers 120 68 0 18:52 pts/0 00:00:00 ps -afe   Log out from the UAI\nvers@uai-vers-a00fb46b-6889b666db-4dfvn:~\u0026gt; exit ncn#   Clean up the UAI.\nncn# cray uas delete --uai-list $UAINAME Expected output looks similar to the following:\nresults = [ \u0026#34;Successfully deleted uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026#34;,]   If the commands ran with similar results, then the basic functionality of the UAS and UAI is working.\n5.3 UAS/UAI Troubleshooting The following subsections include common failure modes seen with UAS / UAI operations and how to resolve them.\n5.3.1 Authorization Issues An error will be returned when running CLI commands if the user is not logged in as a valid Keycloak user or is accidentally using the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable. This variable is set regardless of the user credentials being used.\nFor example:\nncn# cray uas list The symptom of this problem is output similar to the following:\nUsage: cray uas list [OPTIONS] Try \u0026#39;cray uas list --help\u0026#39; for help. Error: Bad Request: Token not valid for UAS. Attributes missing: [\u0026#39;gidNumber\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;loginShell\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;homeDirectory\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;uidNumber\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] Fix this by logging in as a real user (someone with actual Linux credentials) and making sure that CRAY_CREDENTIALS is unset.\n5.3.2 UAS Cannot Access Keycloak When running CLI commands, a Keycloak error may be returned.\nFor example:\nncn# cray uas list The symptom of this problem is output similar to the following:\nUsage: cray uas list [OPTIONS] Try \u0026#39;cray uas list --help\u0026#39; for help. Error: Internal Server Error: An error was encountered while accessing Keycloak If the wrong hostname was used to reach the API gateway, re-run the CLI initialization steps above and try again to check that. There may also be a problem with the Istio service mesh inside of the system. Troubleshooting this is beyond the scope of this section, but there may be useful information in the UAS pod logs in Kubernetes. There are generally two UAS pods, so the user may need to look at logs from both to find the specific failure. The logs tend to have a very large number of GET events listed as part of the liveness checking.\nThe following shows an example of looking at UAS logs effectively (this example shows only one UAS manager, normally there would be two):\n  Determine the pod name of the uas-mgr pod\nncn# kubectl get po -n services | grep \u0026#34;^cray-uas-mgr\u0026#34; | grep -v etcd Expected output looks similar to:\ncray-uas-mgr-6bbd584ccb-zg8vx 2/2 Running 0 12d   Set PODNAME to the name of the manager pod whose logs are going to be viewed.\nncn# export PODNAME=cray-uas-mgr-6bbd584ccb-zg8vx   View the last 25 log entries of the cray-uas-mgr container in that pod, excluding GET events:\nncn# kubectl logs -n services $PODNAME cray-uas-mgr | grep -v \u0026#39;GET \u0026#39; | tail -25 Example output:\n2021-02-08 15:32:41,211 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting deployment uai-vers-87a0ff6e in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:32:41,225 - uas_mgr - INFO - creating deployment uai-vers-87a0ff6e in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:32:41,241 - uas_mgr - INFO - creating the UAI service uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh 2021-02-08 15:32:41,241 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting service uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:32:41,252 - uas_mgr - INFO - creating service uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:32:41,267 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting pod info uai-vers-87a0ff6e 2021-02-08 15:32:41,360 - uas_mgr - INFO - No start time provided from pod 2021-02-08 15:32:41,361 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting service info for uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 127.0.0.1 - - [08/Feb/2021 15:32:41] \u0026#34;POST /v1/uas?imagename=registry.local%2Fcray%2Fno-image-registered%3A1.0.11 HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 200 - 2021-02-08 15:32:54,455 - uas_auth - INFO - UasAuth lookup complete for user vers 2021-02-08 15:32:54,455 - uas_mgr - INFO - UAS request for: vers 2021-02-08 15:32:54,455 - uas_mgr - INFO - listing deployments matching: host None, labels uas=managed,user=vers 2021-02-08 15:32:54,484 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting pod info uai-vers-87a0ff6e 2021-02-08 15:32:54,596 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting service info for uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:40:25,053 - uas_auth - INFO - UasAuth lookup complete for user vers 2021-02-08 15:40:25,054 - uas_mgr - INFO - UAS request for: vers 2021-02-08 15:40:25,054 - uas_mgr - INFO - listing deployments matching: host None, labels uas=managed,user=vers 2021-02-08 15:40:25,085 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting pod info uai-vers-87a0ff6e 2021-02-08 15:40:25,212 - uas_mgr - INFO - getting service info for uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:40:51,210 - uas_auth - INFO - UasAuth lookup complete for user vers 2021-02-08 15:40:51,210 - uas_mgr - INFO - UAS request for: vers 2021-02-08 15:40:51,210 - uas_mgr - INFO - listing deployments matching: host None, labels uas=managed,user=vers 2021-02-08 15:40:51,261 - uas_mgr - INFO - deleting service uai-vers-87a0ff6e-ssh in namespace user 2021-02-08 15:40:51,291 - uas_mgr - INFO - delete deployment uai-vers-87a0ff6e in namespace user 127.0.0.1 - - [08/Feb/2021 15:40:51] \u0026#34;DELETE /v1/uas?uai_list=uai-vers-87a0ff6e HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 200 -   5.3.3 UAI Images not in Registry When listing or describing a UAI, an error in the uai_msg field may be returned. For example:\nncn# cray uas list There may be something similar to the following output:\n[[results]] uai_age = \u0026#34;0m\u0026#34; uai_connect_string = \u0026#34;ssh vers@10.103.13.172\u0026#34; uai_host = \u0026#34;ncn-w001\u0026#34; uai_img = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp3:1.0.11\u0026#34; uai_ip = \u0026#34;10.103.13.172\u0026#34; uai_msg = \u0026#34;ErrImagePull\u0026#34; uai_name = \u0026#34;uai-vers-87a0ff6e\u0026#34; uai_status = \u0026#34;Waiting\u0026#34; username = \u0026#34;vers\u0026#34; This means the pre-made end-user UAI image is not in the local registry (or whatever registry it is being pulled from; see the uai_img value for details). To correct this, locate and push/import the image to the registry.\n5.3.4 Missing Volumes and other Container Startup Issues Various packages install volumes in the UAS configuration. All of those volumes must also have the underlying resources available, sometimes on the host node where the UAI is running sometimes from with Kubernetes. If a UAI gets stuck with a ContainerCreating uai_msg field for an extended time, this is a likely cause. UAIs run in the user Kubernetes namespace, and are pods that can be examined using kubectl describe.\n  Locate the pod.\nncn# kubectl get po -n user | grep \u0026lt;uai-name\u0026gt;   Investigate the problem using the pod name from the previous step.\nncn# kubectl describe pod -n user \u0026lt;pod-name\u0026gt; If volumes are missing they will show up in the Events: section of the output. Other problems may show up there as well. The names of the missing volumes or other issues should indicate what needs to be fixed to make the UAI run.\n  "

	"content": "Troubleshooting Ceph MDS Reporting Slow Requests and Failure on Client Use this procedure to troubleshoot Ceph MDS reporting slow requests after following the Identify Ceph Latency Issues procedure.\n IMPORTANT: This procedure includes a mix of commands that need to be run on the host(s) running the MDS daemon(s) and other commands that can be run from any of the ceph-mon nodes.\n  NOTICE: These steps are based off upstream Ceph documentation.\n Prerequisites  The Identify Ceph Latency Issues procedure has been completed. This issue has been encountered and this page is being used as a reference for commands. The correct version of the documentation for the cluster running is being used.  Procedure   Identify the active MDS.\nncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph fs status -f json-pretty|jq -r \u0026#39;.mdsmap[]|select(.state==\u0026#34;active\u0026#34;)|.name\u0026#39; cephfs.ncn-s003.ihwkop   ssh to the host running the active MDS.\n  Enter into a cephadm shell.\nncn-s003# cephadm shell Example output:\nInferring fsid 7350865a-0b21-11ec-b9fa-fa163e06c459 Inferring config /var/lib/ceph/7350865a-0b21-11ec-b9fa-fa163e06c459/mon.ncn-s003/config Using recent ceph image arti.dev.cray.com/third-party-docker-stable-local/ceph/ ceph@sha256:70536e31b29a4241999ec4fd13d93e5860a5ffdc5467911e57e6bf04dfe68337 [ceph: root@ncn-s003 /]#  NOTE: Messages such as \u0026ldquo;WARNING: The same type, major and minor should not be used for multiple devices\u0026rdquo; can be ignored. There is an upstream bug to address this issue.\n   Dump in-flight ops.\n[ceph: root@ncn-s003 /]# ceph daemon mds.cephfs.ncn-s003.ihwkop dump_ops_in_flight Example output:\n{ \u0026quot;ops\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;num_ops\u0026quot;: 0 }  NOTE: The example above is about how to run the command. Recreating the exact scenario to provide a full example is not easily done. This will be updated when the information is available.\n   General Steps from Upstream   Identify the stuck commands and examine why they are stuck.\n  Usually the last \u0026ldquo;event\u0026rdquo; will have been an attempt to gather locks, or sending the operation off to the MDS log.\n  If it is waiting on the OSDs, fix them.\n  If operations are stuck on a specific inode, you probably have a client holding caps which prevent others from using it, either because the client is trying to flush out dirty data or because you have encountered a bug in CephFS' distributed file lock code (the file \u0026ldquo;capabilities\u0026rdquo; [\u0026ldquo;caps\u0026rdquo;] system).\n If it is a result of a bug in the capabilities code, restarting the MDS is likely to resolve the problem.    If there are no slow requests reported on the MDS, and it is not reporting that clients are misbehaving, either the client has a problem or its requests are not reaching the MDS.\n    "

In the example output above, the following troubleshooting information can be observed:\n health - Shows latency and what daemons/OSDs are associated with it. mds - MDS is functional, but it is in replay because of the slow ops. osd - All OSDs are up and in. This could be related to a network issue or a single system issue if both OSDs are on the same box. client - Shows the amount of IO/Throughput that clients using Ceph are performing. If health is not set to HEALTH_OK and traffic is passing through, then Ceph is functioning and re-balancing data because of typical hardware/network issues. recovery - Shows recovery traffic as the system ensures all the copies of data are available to ensure data redundancy.    Fixes Based on the output from ceph -s (using our example above) we can correlate some information to help determine our bottleneck.\n  When reporting slow ops for OSDs, then it is good to find out if those OSDs are on the same node or different nodes.\n If the OSDs are on the same node, then look at networking or other hardware-related issues on that node. If the OSDs are on different nodes, then investigate networking issues.  As an initial step, restart the OSDs, if the slow ops go away and do not return, then we can investigate the logs for possible software bugs or memory issues. If the slow ops come right back, then there is an issue with replication between the 2 OSDs which tends to be network-related.      When reporting slow ops for MONs, then it is typically an issue with the process.\n The most common cause here is either an abrupt clock skew or a hung mon/mgr process.  The recommended remediation is to do a rolling restart of the Ceph MON and MGR daemons.      When reporting slow ops for MDS, then are multiple possible causes.\n If listed in addition to OSDs, then the root cause for this is typically the OSDs, and the process above should be used, followed by restarting the MDS daemons. If it is only listing MDS, then restart the MDS daemons. If the problem persists, then examine the logs in order to determine the root cause. See Troubleshoot_Ceph_MDS_reporting_slow_requests_and_failure_on_client for additional steps to help identify MDS slow ops    "

	"content": "Restore Nexus Data After Data Corruption In rare cases, if a Ceph upgrade is not completed successfully and has issues, the eventual Ceph health can end up with a damaged mds (cephfs) daemon. Ceph reports this as follows running the ceph -s command:\nncn-s002# ceph -s Example output:\n cluster: id: 7ed70f4c-852e-494a-b9e7-5f722af6d6e7 health: HEALTH_ERR 1 filesystem is degraded 1 filesystem is offline 1 mds daemon damaged When Ceph is in this state, Nexus will likely not operate properly and can be recovered using the following procedure.\nProcedure The commands in this procedure should be run from a master NCN (unless otherwise noted).\n  Determine where the originally installed Nexus helm chart and manifest exists.\nDuring normal installs, the initial artifacts (docker images and helm charts) are available on ncn-m001 in /mnt/pitdata after it has been rebooted out of PIT mode. The administrator may need to re-mount this volume (first step below):\n  Re-mount the volume.\nncn-m001# mount -vL PITDATA /mnt/pitdata   Find the Nexus helm chart to use.\nncn-m001# ls /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/helm/*nexus* Expected output:\n/mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/helm/cray-nexus-0.6.0.tgz \u0026lt;-- this is the helm chart to use   Find the Nexus manifest to use.\nncn-m001# ls /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/manifests/nexus.yaml Expected output:\n/mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/manifests/nexus.yaml \u0026lt;-- this is the manifest to use  NOTE: Do not proceed with further steps until these two files are located, as they are necessary to re-install the helm chart after deletion.\n     Uninstall the Nexus helm chart.\nncn-m001# helm uninstall -n nexus cray-nexus   Delete the backing Nexus PVC.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n nexus delete pvc nexus-data   Re-install the cray-nexus helm chart (using the chart and manifest determined in step 1).\nncn-m001# loftsman ship --manifest-path /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/manifests/nexus.yaml --charts-path /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/helm/cray-nexus-0.6.0.tgz   Re-populate Nexus with 0.9.x artifacts.\nDepending on where initial PIT data was determined in step 1, now locate the Nexus setup script:\nncn-m001# ls /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/lib/setup-nexus.sh /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/lib/setup-nexus.sh Re-populate the 0.9.x artifacts by running the setup-nexus.sh script:\nncn-m001# /mnt/pitdata/csm-0.9.4/lib/setup-nexus.sh   Re-populate Nexus with 1.0 artifacts. This step is also necessary if the mds/cephfs corruption occurred when upgrading from 0.9.x to 1.0. Nexus must be populated with both versions of the artifacts in order to support both old/new docker images during upgrade.\nLocate the Nexus setup script, this is typically in /root/csm-1.0.* on ncn-m001:\nncn-m001# ls /root/csm-1.0.0-beta.50/lib/setup-nexus.sh /root/csm-1.0.0-beta.50/lib/setup-nexus.sh Re-populate the 1.0.x artifacts by running the setup-nexus.sh script:\nncn-m001# /root/csm-1.0.0-beta.50/lib/setup-nexus.sh   Re-populate Nexus with any add-on products that had been installed on this system.\nIf any additional products were installed on this system after initial install, locate the install documentation for those products and re-run the appropriate portion of their install script(s) to load those artifacts back into Nexus. For example, if SLES repositories have been added to Nexus prior to this content restore, refer to the install documentation contained in that distribution\u0026rsquo;s tar file for instructions on how to again load that content into Nexus.\n  Scale up any deployments/statefulsets that may have been scaled down during upgrade (if applicable). These commands should be run from ncn-s001.\nSource the k8s-scale-utils.sh script in order to define the scale_up_cephfs_clients function:\nncn-m001# source /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0/scripts/ceph/lib/k8s-scale-utils.sh Execute the scale_up_cephfs_clients function in order to scale up any cephfs clients that may still be scaled down:\nncn-m001# scale_up_cephfs_clients   "

	"content": "Shrink the Ceph Cluster This procedure describes how to remove a Ceph node from the Ceph cluster. Once the node is removed, the cluster is also rebalanced to account for the changes. Use this procedure to reduce the size of a cluster.\nPrerequisites  This procedure requires administrative privileges. 3 ssh sessions.  1 to monitor the cluster. 1 to perform cluster wide actions from a ceph-mon node. 1 to perform node only actions on the node being removed.    IMPORTANT NOTES  Permanent removal of ncn-s001, ncn-s002, or ncn-s003 is NOT SUPPORTED. They can only be rebuilt in place or replaced with new hardware.  This is due to the Ceph mon and mgr processes running on them.   Always ensure you have the free capacity to remove the node(s) prior to performing this task.

	"content": "Ceph Health States Ceph reports several different health states depending on the condition of a cluster. These health states can provide a lot of information about the current functionality of the Ceph cluster, what troubleshooting steps needs to be taken, and if a support ticket needs to be filed.\nThe health of a Ceph cluster can be viewed with the following command:\nncn-m001# ceph -s Example output:\ncluster: id: 5f3b4031-d6c0-4118-94c0-bffd90b534eb health: HEALTH_OK \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-- Health state [...] The following is an overview of potential health states:\n  HEALTH_OK\nThe cluster is operating as expected with no issues.\n  HEALTH_WARN\nThere is a WARNING condition on the cluster. There are lots of potential causes, but this warning does not mean any functionality is lost. For example, this health state could occur if a pool is at its quota. This health state does not mean that the cluster is not servicing data.\nMost HEALTH_WARN states resolve on their own as they pertain to functionality that tends to self correct.\n  HEALTH_ERROR\nThere is an ERROR condition on the cluster. This is typical for a configuration issue or if there is a component that is having issues completing its functions. This does not mean that the cluster is not servicing data. The HEALTH_ERROR state is primarily for individual components experiencing issues.\nMost HEALTH_ERROR states may not be covered by troubleshooting documentation and should result in a ticket to customer support for guidance.\n  HEALTH_CRITICAL\nThere is a CRITICAL condition on the cluster. This means that cluster functions have stopped or have gone into read-only mode to protect data. When this is present, the cluster is not servicing data properly, or even at all in order to protect data integrity. This will be dependent on the configuration and the reason behind the CRITICAL health state.\nAll HEALTH_CRITICAL states should result in an immediate ticket to customer support for guidance on returning the cluster back to service.\n  For a list of possible states, refer to https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/health-checks/.\n"

	"content": "Ceph Orchestrator Usage The Ceph orchestrator provides a centralized interface for the management of the Ceph cluster. It orchestrates ceph-mgr modules that interface with external orchestration services.\nRefer to the external Ceph documentation for more information.\nThe orchestrator manages Ceph clusters with the following capabilities:\n Single command upgrades (assuming all images are in place) Reduces the need to be on the physical server to address a large number of ceph service restarts or configuration changes Better integration with the Ceph Dashboard (coming soon) Ability to write custom orchestration modules  Troubleshoot Ceph Orchestrator Watch cephadm Log Messages Watching log messages is useful when making changes with the orchestrator, such as add/remove/scale services or upgrades.\nncn-s# ceph -w cephadm To watch log messages with debug:\nncn-s# ceph config set mgr mgr/cephadm/log_to_cluster_level debug ncn-s# ceph -W cephadm --watch-debug  NOTE: For use with orchestration tasks, this can be typically run from a node running the ceph mon process. In most cases, this is ncn-s00(1/2/3).

In a future release this alert will be renamed to be more generic. If this alert fires, inspect the IP address in the details of the alert to determine the node in question (it can be storage, master, or worker node). If the interface in question is determined to be healthy, then this alert can be ignored.\nCPUThrottlingHigh Alerts for CPUThrottlingHigh on gatekeeper-audit can be ignored. This pod is not utilized in this release.\nAlerts for CPUThrottlingHigh on gatekeeper-controller-manager can be ignored. These have low CPU requests, and it is normal for resource usage to spike when it is in use.\nAlerts for CPUThrottlingHigh on smartmon pods can be ignored. It is normal for smartmon pods' resource usage to spike when it is polling. This will be fixed in a future release.\nAlerts for CPUThrottlingHigh on CFS services such as cfs-batcher and cfs-trust can be ignored. Because CFS is idle most of the time, these services have low CPU requests, and it is normal for CFS service resource usage to spike when it is in use.\nKubePodNotReady Alerts for KubePodNotReady on cray-crus may be ignored if the Slurm software has not been installed. The cray-crus pod interacts with Slurm to manage compute node rolling upgrades.\nPostgresqlFollowerReplicationLagSMA Alerts for PostgresqlFollowerReplicationLagSMA on sma-postgres-cluster pods with slot_name=\u0026quot;permanent_physical_1\u0026quot; can be ignored. This slot_name is disabled and will be removed in a future release.\nPostgresqlHighRollbackRate Alerts for PostgresqlHighRollbackRate on spire-postgres and smd-postgres pods can be ignored. This is caused by an idle session that requires a timeout. This will be fixed in a future release.\nPostgresqlInactiveReplicationSlot Alerts for PostgresqlInactiveReplicationSlot on sma-postgres-cluster pods with slot_name=\u0026quot;permanent_physical_1\u0026quot; can be ignored. This slot_name is disabled and will be removed in a future release.\nPostgresqlNotEnoughConnections Alerts for PostgresqlNotEnoughConnections for datname=\u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; and datname=\u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; can be ignored. These databases are not used and will be removed in a future release.\nTargetDown Many of the alerts for TargetDown for sysmgmt-health/cray-sysmgmt-health-kubernetes-pods/0 are due to job pods that have Completed and no longer have an active endpoint that can be scraped. If the target that is down is from a job pod that has completed, the TargetDown alert for that pod can be ignored. This is being fixed in a future release.\n"

	"content": "System Management Health The primary goal of the System Management Health service is to enable system administrators to assess the health of their system. Operators need to quickly and efficiently troubleshoot system issues as they occur and be confident that a lack of issues indicates the system is operating normally. This service currently runs as a Helm chart on the system\u0026rsquo;s management Kubernetes cluster and monitors the health status of core system components, triggering alerts as potential issues are observed. It uses Prometheus to aggregate metrics from etcd, Kubernetes, Istio, and Ceph, all of which include support for the Prometheus API. The System Management Health service relies on the following tools:\n Prometheus is the standard cloud-native metrics and monitoring tool, which includes Alertmanager, a tool that handles alert duplication, silences, and notifications The Prometheus operator provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) that make it easy to operate Prometheus and Alertmanager instances, scrape metrics from service endpoints, and trigger alerts Grafana supports pulling data from Prometheus, and dashboards for system components are readily available from the open source community The stable/prometheus-operator Helm chart integrates the Prometheus operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, node exporters (daemon set), and kube-state-metrics to provide a monitoring solution for Kubernetes clusters Istio supports service mesh tracing and observability using Jaeger and Kiali, respectively  The System Management Health service is intended to complement the System Monitoring Application (SMA) Framework, but the two are currently not integrated. The System Management Health metrics are not available using the Telemetry API. This service scrapes metrics from system components like Ceph, Kubernetes, and the hosts using node exporter, kube-state-metrics, and cadvisor. The design is flexible and supports:\n Filtering metrics such that only those necessary to determine system health are aggregated to the top level; all metrics are currently aggregated—no filtering is implemented Independent retention and persistence settings based on needs for specific services; the current default configuration retains metrics for ten days at the top level and four hours at intermediate levels Component-specific tooling for more detailed visibility:  Grafana dashboards for Kubernetes Grafana dashboards, Kiali, and Jaeger for Istio Grafana dashboards for Ceph    "

	"content": "System Management Health Checks and Alerts A health check corresponds to a Prometheus query against metrics aggregated to the Prometheus instance. Core platform components like Kubernetes and Istio collect service-related metrics by default, which enables the System Management Health service to implement generic service health checks without custom instrumentation. Health checks are intended to be coarse-grained and comprehensive, as opposed to fine-grained and exhaustive. Health checks related to infrastructure adhere to the Utilization Saturation Errors (USE) method whereas services follow the Rate Errors Duration (RED) method.\nPrometheus alerting rules periodically evaluate health checks and trigger alerts to Alertmanager, which manages silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and sending out notifications. Alertmanager supports a number of notification options, but the most relevant ones are listed below:\n Email - Sends notification emails periodically regarding alerts Slack - Publishes notifications to a Slack channel Web hook- Send an HTTP request to a configurable URL (requires custom integration)  Similar to Prometheus metrics, alerts use labels to identify a particular dimensional instantiation, and the Alertmanager dashboard enables operators to preemptively silence alerts based on them.\nCheck Active Alerts from NCNs Prometheus includes the /api/v1/alerts endpoint, which returns a JSON object containing the active alerts. From a non-compute node (NCN), can connect to sysmgmt-health/cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus directly and bypass service authentication and authorization.\nObtain the cluster IP address:\nncn-w001# kubectl -n sysmgmt-health get svc cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus Example output:\nNAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus ClusterIP 10.16.201.80 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 9090/TCP 2d6h Get active alerts, which includes KubeletTooManyPods if it is going off:\nncn-w001# curl -s http://CLUSTER-IP:PORT/api/v1/alerts | jq . | grep -B 10 -A 20 KubeletTooManyPods Example output:\n{ \u0026quot;status\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;success\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;alerts\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;alertname\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;KubeletTooManyPods\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;endpoint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https-metrics\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;instance\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.1.6:10250\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;job\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;kubelet\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;namespace\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;kube-system\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;node\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ncn-w003\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;prometheus\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;kube-monitoring/cray-prometheus-operator-prometheus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;prometheus_replica\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;prometheus-cray-prometheus-operator-prometheus-0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;service\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cray-prometheus-operator-kubelet\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;severity\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;warning\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;annotations\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Kubelet 10.252.1.6:10250 is running 107 Pods, close to the limit of 110.\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;runbook_url\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin/tree/master/runbook.md#alert-name-kubelettoomanypods\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;firing\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;activeAt\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-01-11T18:13:35.086499854Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 107 }, { \u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;: { In the example above, the alert actually indicates it is getting close to the limit, but the value included in the alert is the actual number of pods on ncn-w003.\nTroubleshooting: If an alert titled KubeCronJobRunning is encountered, this could be an indication that a Kubernetes cronjob is misbehaving.

These parameters are typically set during discovery, but this tool enables parameters to be set before or after discovery. The operations to change these parameters are available in the cray CLI under the scsd command.\nThe parameters which can be set are:\n  SSH key\n  NTP server\n  Syslog server\n  BMC/Controller passwords\n  SSH console key\nIMPORTANT: If the scsd tool is used to update the SSHConsoleKey value outside of ConMan, it will disrupt the ConMan connection to the console and collection of console logs. See ConMan for more information about remote consoles and collecting console logs.\n  However, this procedure only describes how to change the SSH key to enable passwordless SSH for troubleshooting of power down and power up logs on the node BMCs.\nSee Manage Parameters with the scsd Service for more information about these topics for changing the other parameters.\n Retrieve Current Information from Targets Retrieve Information from a Single target Set Parameters for Targets Set Parameters for a Single BMC or Controller Set Redfish Credentials for Multiple Targets Set Redfish Credentials for a Single Target  The NTP server and syslog server for BMCs in the liquid-cooled cabinet are typically set by MEDS.\nDetails Setting the SSH keys for mountain controllers is done by running the /opt/cray/csm/scripts/admin_access/set_ssh_keys.py script:\nUsage: set_ssh_keys.py [options] --debug=level Set debug level --dryrun Gather all info but do not set anything in HW. --exclude=list Comma-separated list of target patterns to exclude. Each item in the list is matched on the front of each target component name (xname) and excluded if there is a match. Example: x1000,x3000c0,x9000c1s0 This will exclude all BMCs in cabinet x1000, all BMCs at or below x3000c0, and all BMCs below x9000c1s0. NOTE: --include and --exclude are mutually exclusive. --include=list Comma-separated list of target patterns to include.

These parameters are typically set during discovery, but this tool enables parameters to be set before or after discovery. The operations to change these parameters are available in the Cray CLI under the scsd command.\nThe following are the parameters that most commonly must be set:\n  SSH keys\nIMPORTANT: If the scsd tool is used to update the SSHConsoleKey value outside of ConMan, it will disrupt the ConMan connection to the console and collection of console logs. Refer to ConMan for more information.\n  NTP server\n  Syslog server\n  BMC/Controller passwords\n  The scsd tool includes a REST API to facilitate operations to set parameters. It will contact the Hardware State Manager (HSM) to verify that targets are correct and in a valid hardware state, unless the \u0026ldquo;Force\u0026rdquo; flag is specified. Once it has a list of targets, scsd will perform the needed Redfish operations in parallel using TRS. Any credentials needed will be retrieved from Vault.\nIn all POST operation payloads, there is an optional \u0026ldquo;Force\u0026rdquo; parameter. If this parameter is present and set to \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo;, then HSM will not be contacted and the Redfish operations will be attempted without verifying they are present or in a good state. If the \u0026ldquo;Force\u0026rdquo; option is not present, or is present but set to \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;, HSM will be used.\nThe specified targets can be BMCs, controller component names (xnames), or HSM group IDs. If BMCs and controllers are grouped in HSM, this service becomes much easier to use because single targets can be used rather than long lists.\nTo view the current build version of the scsd service:\nncn-m001# cray scsd version list "

	"content": "Set NCN User Passwords The management node images do not contain a default root password or default SSH keys.\nUse one of these methods to change or set the root password in the image.\n  If the PIT node is booted, see Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node for more information.\n  If the PIT node is not booted, see Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys for more information.\n  The rest of this procedure describes how to change the root password stored in the HashiCorp Vault instance and then apply it immediately to management nodes with the csm.password Ansible role via a CFS session. The same root password from Vault will be applied anytime that the NCN personalization including the CSM layer is run. If no password is added to Vault as in the procedure below, this Ansible role will skip any password updates.\nNew in CSM Release 1.2.0 The location of the password secret in Vault has changed in CSM version 1.2. The previous location (secret/csm/management_nodes root_password=...) has been changed to secret/csm/users/root password=.... You must set the password in the new location using the Configure Root Password in Vault procedure below for it to be applied to the NCNs.\nProcedure: Configure Root Password in Vault   Generate a new password hash for the root user. Type in your new password after running the read command. The echo will verify that the hash is set to the password you expect.\nncn# read -s NEWPASSWORD ncn# openssl passwd -6 -salt $(\u0026lt; /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c4) \u0026#34;$NEWPASSWORD\u0026#34; ncn# echo \u0026#34;Password: $NEWPASSWORD\u0026#34;   Get the HashiCorp Vault root token:\nncn# kubectl get secrets -n vault cray-vault-unseal-keys -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.vault-root}\u0026#39; | base64 -d; echo   Write the password hash from step 1 to the HashiCorp Vault. The vault login command will request the token value from the output of step 2 above. The vault read command verifies the hash was stored correctly.\nNOTE:: It is important to enclose the hash in single quotes to preserve any special characters.\nncn# kubectl exec -itn vault cray-vault-0 -- sh cray-vault-0# export VAULT_ADDR=http://cray-vault:8200 cray-vault-0# vault login cray-vault-0# vault write secret/csm/users/root password=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;INSERT HASH HERE\u0026gt;\u0026#39; [... other fields (see warning below) ...] cray-vault-0# vault read secret/csm/users/root cray-vault-0# exit ncn#  WARNING: The CSM instance of HashiCorp Vault does not support the patch operation, only write. Ensure that if the password field in the secret/csm/users/root secret is being updated that the other fields, for example the user\u0026rsquo;s SSH keys, are also updated. Updating the password without including values for the other fields will result in loss of data of the other fields.\n The path to the secret and the password field are configurable locations in the CSM csm.password Ansible role located in the CSM configuration management Git repository that is in use. If not using the defaults as shown in the command above, ensure that the paths are consistent between Vault and the values in the Ansible role. See roles/csm.password/README.md in the repository for more information.\n  Procedure: Apply Root Password to NCNs (Standalone) Use the following procedure with the rotate-pw-mgmt-nodes.yml playbook to only change the root password on NCNs. This is a quick alternative to running a full NCN personalization, where passwords are also applied using the password stored in Vault set in the procedure above.\n  Create a CFS configuration layer to run the password change Ansible playbook. Replace the branch name in the JSON below with the commit in the CSM configuration management Git repository that is in use.\nncn# cat ncn-password-update-config.json Example output:\n{ \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ncn-password-update\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cloneUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;playbook\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;rotate-pw-mgmt-nodes.yml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;INSERT GIT COMMIT ID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } ] } ncn# cray cfs configurations update ncn-password-update --file ./ncn-password-update-config.json   Create a CFS configuration session to apply the password update.\nncn# cray cfs sessions create --name ncn-password-update-`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` --configuration-name ncn-password-update NOTE: Subsequent password changes need only update the password hash in HashiCorp Vault and create the CFS session as long as the commit in the CSM configuration management repository has not changed. If the commit has changed, repeat this procedure from the beginning.\n  Procedure for Other Users The csm.password Ansible role supports setting passwords for non-root users. Make a copy of the rotate-pw-mgmt-nodes.yml Ansible playbook and modify the role variables to specify a different password_username and use that username when adding the hashed password to Vault as in the Configure Root Password in Vault above. Follow the procedure and then create a configuration layer using the new Ansible playbook and create a CFS session using that layer.\n"

Slingshot switch BMC default credentials must be changed using the procedures in the Slingshot product documentation. To update Slingshot switch BMCs, refer to \u0026ldquo;Change Rosetta Login and Redfish API Credentials\u0026rdquo; in the Slingshot Operations Guide (\u0026gt; 1.6.0).\nThis procedure provisions only the default Redfish root account passwords.

All of the CECs must be configured with the same global credential. The previous default global credential for liquid-cooled BMCs needs to be known.  Procedure 1.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Provisioning a Liquid-Cooled EX Cabinet CEC with Default Credentials This procedure provisions a Glibc compatible SHA-512 administrative password hash to a cabinet environmental controller (CEC). This password becomes the Redfish default global credential to access the CMM controllers and node controllers (BMCs).\nThis procedure does not provision Slingshot switch BMCs. Slingshot switch BMC default credentials must be changed using the procedures in the Slingshot product documentation. Refer to \u0026ldquo;Change Rosetta Login and Redfish API Credentials\u0026rdquo; in the Slingshot Operations Guide (\u0026gt; 1.6.0).\nPrerequisites   Physical access to the CEC LCD panel to enable privileged command mode. The CEC does not enable users to set, display, or clear the password hash in restricted command mode.\n  A laptop with a terminal program such as Netcat (nc), telnet, or PuTTY that supports 10/100 IPv6 Ethernet connectivity to the CEC Ethernet port is required.\n  A generated SHA-512 hash for the CEC credentials:\n The passhash tool that is installed on the CMMs can be used to generate a SHA-512 password hash. This HPE tool is provided for convenience, but any tool that generates an SHA-512 hash that is compatible with glibc can be used. The salt portion must be between 8 and 16 chars inclusive. The CEC does not support the optional \u0026ldquo;rounds=\u0026rdquo; parameter in the hash. See the man 3 crypt page for a description: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/crypt.3.html  remote# passhash PASSWORD $6$v5YlqfghB$scBci.GbT8... Note: The example password hash is truncated to prevent using this example value. The password hash is a SHA-512 hash.\n  Procedure   Disconnect the CEC Ethernet cable from the Ethernet port.\n  Connect an Ethernet cable from an Apple Mac or Linux laptop to the CEC Ethernet port. The CEC Ethernet PHY will auto negotiate to either 10/100Mb speed and it supports auto crossover functionality. Any standard Ethernet patch cord should work for this.\n  Use the Right Arrow on the display controls to select the CEC Network Settings Menu. The IPv6 link local address is displayed on this menu.\n  Start the terminal program and use Netcat (nc), telnet, or PuTTY to connect to CEC command shell and provide the CEC IPv6 link local address.\n# nc -t -6 'fe80::a1:3e8:0%en14' 23 # telnet fe80::a1:3e8:0%eth0   en14 and eth0 in these examples are the Ethernet interfaces for the laptop.\n  Enter return a few times to start the connection.\n  Note: If the network connection to the CEC is lost, or if a CEC command does not return to the prompt, it may be necessary to reboot the CEC. Use the Right Arrow on the CEC control panel to display the Action menu, select Reset CEC, and press the green checkmark button to reboot the CEC. Then re-establish the nc or telnet connection.\n    From the CEC\u0026gt; prompt, enter help to view the list of commands.\nCEC\u0026gt; help Caution: Run only the CEC commands in this procedure. Do not change other CEC settings.\n  From the CEC\u0026gt; prompt, generate an unlock token for the CEC. Use the enable command (alias for unlock command) without arguments to display a random unlock token on the CEC front panel.\nCEC\u0026gt; enable ab12903c   Record the unlock token displayed on the CEC front panel.\nThe unlock code is valid as long as the remote shell connection is open to the CEC. If you enter the unlock token incorrectly, a new unlock token is displayed on the front panel.\n  Enter the enable command again but supply the token as an argument to unlock the CEC and enter privileged command mode.\nCEC\u0026gt; enable AB12903C EXE\u0026gt; If the token code is typed in incorrectly a new one is generated on screen. When unlocked, the LCD screen displays UNLOCKED and the shell prompt changes to EXE\u0026gt;.\nDo not use the get_hash command to display the password hash. If there is no password hash set, this command will not return to the prompt and the connection will be lost.\n  Enter set_hash and provide the password hash value as the argument.\nThe CEC validates the input syntax of the hash. Adding an extra char or omitting a character is flagged as an error. I a character is changed, the password entered in the serial console login shell or the Redfish root account will not work. If that happens, rerun the set_hash command on the CEC and reboot the CMMs.\nEXE\u0026gt; set_hash $6$v5YlqxKB$scBci.GbT8... Note: Example truncated to prevent accidental setting of production password hash to example values. The password hash is a SHA-512 hash.\n  Exit privileged command mode.\nEXE\u0026gt; lock CEC\u0026gt; The CEC remains in privileged mode until it is reset with the lock command or if the X button on the CEC front panel is pressed. Typing exit or terminating the connection exits privileged mode. There is no connection timeout.\n  Use the front panel Right Arrow to select the CEC Action menu.\n  Reset the CMMs 3, 2, 1, and 0.\nThe Reset CMM commands reboot either the even numbered, or odd numbered CMMs in the cabinet, depending on which CEC is issuing the commands.\n  Important!: Power cycle the compute blade slots in each chassis.\n  If Cray System Management (CSM) is provisioned, use CAPMC to power cycle the compute blade slots (example show cabinets 1000-1003). Note: If a chassis is not fully populated, specify each slot individually:\nncn-m001# cray capmc xname_off create --xnames x[1000-1003]c[0-7]s[0-7] --format json Check the power status:\nncn-m001# cray capmc get_xname_status create --xnames x[1000-1003]c[0-7] --format json Power on the compute chassis slots:\nncn-m001# cray capmc xname_on create --xnames x[1000-1003]c[0-7]s[0-7] --format json   If the cabinet has not been provisioned with CSM or other management software (bare-metal), the compute chassis slots are most likely powered off. To perform chassis power control operations, SSH to a CMM and and use the redfish -h command to display the power control commands:\n\u0026gt; ssh root@x9000c1 x9000c1:\u0026gt; redfish -h \u0026quot;redfish\u0026quot; -- redfish API debugging tool \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; redfish chassis status redfish chassis power [on|off|forceoff] redfish [blade|perif] [0-7] [on|off|forceoff] redfish node status redfish node [0-1] [on|off|forceoff] \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; x9000c1:\u0026gt;     To test the password, connect to the CMM serial console though the CEC. The IPv6 address is the same, but the port numbers are different as described below.\n#!/bin/bash trap \u0026quot;stty sane \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo ''\u0026quot; EXIT stty -icanon -echo nc -6 'fe80::a1:2328:0%en14' 50000  The even numbered CEC manages the CMM serial console for chassis 0, 2, 4, 6 on TCP port numbers 50000-50003 respectively. The odd numbered CEC manages the CMM serial console for chassis 1, 3, 5, 7 on TCP port numbers 50000-50003 respectively. If using the script shown in the example to connect to the CMM console, type exit to return to the CMM login prompt and enter ctrl-c to close the console connection.    Perform this procedure for each CEC in all system cabinets.\n  HPE Cray EX3000 and EX4000 cabinets have two CECs per cabinet.\n  HPE Cray EX2000 cabinets have a single CEC per cabinet.\n    "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) represents the algorithms, infrastructure, policies, and processes required to leverage applied public key cryptography methods for operational security use cases. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic-curve (ECC) are some example algorithm systems.\nThe use of PKI for the system is in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is the successor of the now deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This is where trusted chains of Certificate Authorities (CAs) are used to authenticate the identity of servers, and sometimes clients (for example, mutual TLS) for relying parties. This chain of trust is anchored by a root CA and is used to make assertions that a particular public and private key pair belong to a given party by assigning a certificate for the party. This party is still required to prove they actually own the key material through enciphering, deciphering, and digital signature operations that require private keys that are not shared amongst parties. However, public keys are shared through certificates and are policy bound in that respect.\nThe PKI implementation for the system, post-installation, is made up of Kubernetes services (illustrated in the \u0026ldquo;Public Key Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; figure). During installation, the platform can be directed to either generate certificate authorities (CAs), or a customer-supplied intermediate CA can be supplied. After installation, the CA material resides in a Kubernetes Secret, and ultimately in the HashiCorp Vault.\nRefer to PKI Services for more information on the services in the figure above.\nLimitations The following limitations exist within the PKI implementation:\n  An outstanding bug in the Keycloak Gatekeeper service prevents it from updating its TLS certificate and key material upon Cert-manager renewal\n It may be necessary to monitor the situation and proactively renew/force reload Keycloak Gatekeeper.    Supported Cryptography Suite(s)\n  RSA-based CAs and certificates are currently supported. CAs must have either a 3072- or 4096-bit modulus and use SHA256 as the signature algorithm. Installation paths are designed to force convention.\nPassword encrypted private keys are also not currently supported.\n    CA \u0026ldquo;Rotation\u0026rdquo;\n Changing the platform CA post-installation is not currently supported. Changing it requires a re-install.    Implications of Transitive Trust\n  If the platform is configured to generate a dynamic CA, then customer services or users that interact with the platform must trust the platform CA to validate TLS sessions. Thus, provided the platform has a disjoint DNS domain name (for example, shasta.acme.org), and the PKI trust realm is established at or \u0026lsquo;below\u0026rsquo; (subdomains) this FQDN, a compromise of platform CA material should be limited to the platform itself (subject to many nuances).\nIf a customer supplies a CA to the platform, and the CA is part of an expanded PKI trust realm, a compromise of platform CA material could be leveraged to compromise the broader environment through PKI APIs available on the system. Customers should consider this risk, and, if providing a CA is desired, maybe strictly limit the PKI trust realm established by the provided CA.\n    Abuse of PKI APIs to Sign Malicious Products\n  Compromise of a platform could lead to the generation of certificates for potentially malicious workloads.\nCurrent HashiCorp Vault policies that control legitimate signing activities are fairly broad in allowed certificate CSR properties. This is due largely to common name and SAN requirements for certificate workloads across the platform.\n    Security of CA Material\n  During installation, CA material is exposed:\n  When they are staged by the installer\n  By installation processes (e.g., shasta-cfg) After installation, CA material is exposed:\n  In a SealedSecret\n  In a Kubernetes Secret\n  In Kubernetes etcd backups and backups taken of the platform otherwise\n  To Vault\n  Through the creation of additional subordinate CAs for Spire\n      Revocation Lists and OSCP\n The platform does not provide revocation lists or access to a revocation service (OSCP).    Key Escrow\n The platform does not provide any key escrow services.    "

See Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys for more information on changing the default keys during install. It is a recommended best practice for system security to change the SSH keys after the install is complete on a schedule. This procedure defines how to change the keys once the system is operational.\nThe NCN root user keys are stored in the HashiCorp Vault instance, and applied with the csm.ssh_keys Ansible role via a CFS session. If no keys are added to Vault as in the procedure below, this Ansible role will skip any updates.\nProcedure: Configure Root SSH Keys in Vault   Generate a new SSH key pair for the root user. Use ssh-keygen to generate a a new pair or stage an existing pair as desired as per your security policies and procedures.\n  Get the HashiCorp Vault root token:\nncn# kubectl get secrets -n vault cray-vault-unseal-keys -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.vault-root}\u0026#39; | base64 -d; echo   Write the private and public halves of the key pair gathered in step 1 to the HashiCorp Vault. The vault login command will request the token value from the output of step 2 above. The vault read command verifies the keys were stored correctly.\nThe ssh_private_key and ssh_public_key fields should contain the exact content from the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files (if using RSA key types).\nNOTE: It is important to enclose the key content in single quotes to preserve any special characters.\nncn# kubectl exec -itn vault cray-vault-0 -- sh cray-vault-0# export VAULT_ADDR=http://cray-vault:8200 cray-vault-0# vault login cray-vault-0# vault write secret/csm/users/root ssh_private_key=\u0026#39;...\u0026#39; ssh_public_key=\u0026#39;...\u0026#39; [... other fields (see warning below) ...] cray-vault-0# vault read secret/csm/users/root cray-vault-0# exit ncn#  WARNING: The CSM instance of HashiCorp Vault does not support the patch operation. Ensure that if you are updating the ssh_private_key and ssh_public_key field in the secret/csm/users/root secret that you are also update the other fields, for example the user\u0026rsquo;s password.\n The path to the secret and the SSH key fields are configurable locations in the CSM csm.ssh_keys Ansible role located in the CSM configuration management Git repository that is in use. If not using the defaults as shown in the command above, ensure that the paths are consistent between Vault and the values in the Ansible role. See roles/csm.ssh_keys/README.md in the repository for more information.\n  Procedure: Apply Root SSH Keys to NCNs (Standalone) Use the following procedure with the rotate-ssh-keys-mgmt-nodes.yml playbook to only change the root SSH keys on NCNs. This is a quick alternative to running a full NCN personalization, where keys are also applied using the secrets stored in Vault set in the procedure above.\n  Create a CFS configuration layer to run the SSH key change Ansible playbook.

If the commit has changed, repeat this procedure from the beginning.\n  Procedure for Other Users The csm.ssh_key Ansible role supports setting SSH keys for non-root users. Make a copy of the rotate-ssh-keys-mgmt-nodes.yml Ansible playbook and modify the role variables to specify a different ssh_keys_username and use that username when adding the SSH keypair content to Vault as in the procedure above.

	"content": "HashiCorp Vault A deployment of HashiCorp Vault, managed via the Bitnami Bank-vaults operator, stores private and public Certificate Authority (CA) material, and serves APIs through a PKI engine instance. This instance also serves as a general secrets engine for the system.\nKubernetes service account authorization is utilized to authenticate access to Vault. The configuration of Vault, as deployed on the system, can be viewed with the following command:\nncn# kubectl get vault -n vault cray-vault -o yaml A Kubernetes operator manages the deployment of Vault, based on this definition. The operator is deployed to the vault namespace. The resulting instance will also be deployed to the vault namespace.\nIMPORTANT: Changing the cray-vault custom resource definition or modifying data directly in Vault is not supported unless directed by customer support.\nFor more information, refer to the following resources:\n https://banzaicloud.com/docs/bank-vaults/overview/ https://www.vaultproject.io/docs  Storage Model In previous releases, Vault used etcd as a high-availability (HA) storage back-end. Currently, Vault uses HashiCorp\u0026rsquo;s Raft Implementation. Raft is now configured to run natively inside the Vault statefulset instead of as an independent deployment.\nUnseal Keys Vault requires unseal keys for start-up. If the unseal keys are not present, or are incorrect, Vault (by design) will not start. Unseal keys are stored in the cray-vault-unseal-keys Kubernetes Secret on a system, which is inside the vault namespace.\nAdmin Access Administrative access to Vault can be accomplished through the use of the unseal secret. The use of administrative access should be limited to situations where it is truly necessary. Otherwise, Kubernetes service account access should be used.\nTo obtain and use the root token:\nncn# export VAULT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys \\ -n vault -o jsonpath={.data.vault-root} | base64 -d) ncn# kubectl exec -it -n vault -c vault cray-vault-0 -- sh -c \\ \u0026#34;export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200; export \\ VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN; vault secrets list\u0026#34; Kubernetes Service Account Access Vault is configured to allow service account access from the services namespace (among others). This access is tied to a role, which is also subject to specific access policies.\nTo obtain and use the service account token:\nncn# SA_SECRET=$(kubectl -n services get serviceaccounts \\ default -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.secrets[0].name}\u0026#39;) ncn# SA_JWT=$(kubectl -n services get secret $SA_SECRET \\ -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.token}\u0026#39; | base64 --decode) ncn# VAULT_TOKEN=$(kubectl exec -it -n vault -c vault cray-vault-0 \\ -- sh -c \u0026#34;export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200; vault write \\ auth/kubernetes/login role=services jwt=$SA_JWT-format=json\u0026#34; \\ | jq \u0026#34;.auth.client_token\u0026#34; | sed -e \u0026#39;s/\u0026#34;//g\u0026#39;) ncn# kubectl exec -it -n vault -c vault cray-vault-0 -- sh -c \\ \u0026#34;export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200; export \\ VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN; vault kv list secret/\u0026#34; Service account tokens will eventually expire.\nCheck the Status of Vault Clusters Check the status of Vault clusters with the following command:\nncn# for n in $(seq 0 2); do echo \u0026#34;======= Vault status from cray-vault-${n}======\u0026#34;; \\ kubectl exec -it -n vault -c vault cray-vault-${n} -- sh \\ -c \u0026#34;export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200; vault status\u0026#34;; done Example output:\n======= Vault status from cray-vault-0 ====== Key Value --- ----- Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed false Total Shares 5 Threshold 3 Version 1.5.5 Cluster Name vault-cluster-e19b13b8 Cluster ID 3ea3b6a2-f3f8-fda3-d997-454795dc2be5 HA Enabled true HA Cluster https://cray-vault-1:8201 HA Mode standby Active Node Address http://cray-vault.vault:8200 Raft Committed Index 521 Raft Applied Index 521 ======= Vault status from cray-vault-1 ====== Key Value --- ----- Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed false Total Shares 5 Threshold 3 Version 1.5.5 Cluster Name vault-cluster-e19b13b8 Cluster ID 3ea3b6a2-f3f8-fda3-d997-454795dc2be5 HA Enabled true HA Cluster https://cray-vault-1:8201 HA Mode active Raft Committed Index 521 Raft Applied Index 521 ======= Vault status from cray-vault-2 ====== Key Value --- ----- Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed false Total Shares 5 Threshold 3 Version 1.5.5 Cluster Name vault-cluster-e19b13b8 Cluster ID 3ea3b6a2-f3f8-fda3-d997-454795dc2be5 HA Enabled true HA Cluster https://cray-vault-1:8201 HA Mode standby Active Node Address http://cray-vault.vault:8200 Raft Committed Index 521 Raft Applied Index 521 Healthy clusters will have one Vault pod in active HA mode, and two Vault pods in standby HA Mode.

	"content": "Keycloak Operations A service may need to access Keycloak to perform various tasks. These typical uses for a service to access Keycloak include creating a new service account, creating a new user, etc. These operations require Keycloak administrative access. As part of the System Management Services (SMS) installation process, Keycloak is initialized with a Master realm. An administrative client and user are created within this realm. The system installation process adds the information needed for the Keycloak administrator\u0026rsquo;s authentication into a Kubernetes secret that can be accessed by any pod. Using this information and the Keycloak REST API, a service can create an account in the Shasta realm. The Keycloak master administrative authentication information is located in the keycloak-master-admin-auth secret, which includes the following fields:\n  client-id - Client ID for administrative operations\n  user - Username for the Keycloak Master admin.\n  password - Password for the Keycloak Master admin.\n  internal_token_url - URL that can be used to get a token, such as https://istio-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local/keycloak/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token.\nThe pod in the following example gets a Keycloak Master admin token and makes a request to create a client with a user ID attribute mapper.\nncn# kubectl apply -f - \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: kc-admin-example namespace: services spec: containers: - name: kc-admin-example image: alpine command: - sh - -c - \u0026gt;- apk update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apk add --no-cache curl jq \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo endpoint: \\$(cat /mnt/auth/internal_token_url) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo client_id: \\$(cat /mnt/auth/client-id) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo user: \\$(cat /mnt/auth/user) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; TOKEN=\\$(curl -s --cacert /mnt/shasta-ca/certificate_authority.crt -d grant_type=password -d client_id=\\$(cat /mnt/auth/client-id) -d username=\\$(cat /mnt/auth/user) -d password=\\$(cat /mnt/auth/password) \\$(cat /mnt/auth/internal_token_url) | jq -r .access_token) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;=== Making request with token \\$(echo \\$TOKEN | head -c10)... ===\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; curl -is --cacert /mnt/shasta-ca/certificate_authority.crt -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer \\$TOKEN\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publicClient\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;standardFlowEnabled\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;implicitFlowEnabled\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;directAccessGrantsEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;protocolMappers\u0026#34;: [ {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uid-user-attribute-mapper\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;protocolMapper\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;oidc-usermodel-attribute-mapper\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;protocol\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;openid-connect\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;user.attribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;claim.name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;access.token.claim\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;userinfo.token.claim\u0026#34;: true}}]}\u0026#39; https://istio-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local/keycloak/admin/realms/shasta/clients volumeMounts: - name: ca-vol mountPath: /mnt/shasta-ca - name: auth-vol mountPath: \u0026#39;/mnt/auth\u0026#39; readOnly: true volumes: - name: ca-vol configMap: name: cray-configmap-ca-public-key - name: auth-vol secret: secretName: keycloak-master-admin-auth restartPolicy: Never EOF ncn# kubectl logs -n services kc-admin-example Example output:\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz v3.8.1-115-ge3ed6b4e31 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main] v3.8.1-112-g45bdd0edfb [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/community] OK: 9546 distinct packages available fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz (1/7) Installing ca-certificates (20171114-r3) (2/7) Installing nghttp2-libs (1.32.0-r0) (3/7) Installing libssh2 (1.8.0-r3) (4/7) Installing libcurl (7.61.1-r1) (5/7) Installing curl (7.61.1-r1) (6/7) Installing oniguruma (6.8.2-r0) (7/7) Installing jq (1.6_rc1-r1) Executing busybox-1.28.4-r1.trigger Executing ca-certificates-20171114-r3.trigger OK: 7 MiB in 20 packages endpoint: https://istio-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local/keycloak/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token client_id: admin-cli user: admin === Making request with token eyJhbGciOi... === HTTP/1.1 201 Created Content-Length: 0 Connection: keep-alive Location: https://istio-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local/keycloak/admin/realms/shasta/clients/070c8537-6c46-43a4-b0bb-209b3c4b94c6 Date: Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:07:39 GMT X-Kong-Upstream-Latency: 27 X-Kong-Proxy-Latency: 1 Via: kong/0.14.1 The new example client is now visible in the Keycloak administrative web application.\n  "

	"content": "Keycloak User Management with kcadm.sh Overview The Cray CLI requires a valid Keycloak JWT token. If the token is not present it must be obtained by supplying valid user credentials at the time of CLI initialization. During the installation or upgrade of a Shasta system, the Keycloak user LDAP federation state or credentials may not be known, or the external LDAP system for which the user may have been federated may not be available. These scenarios make it impossible to initialize the Cray CLI with a previously valid Keycloak user or LDAP federated Keycloak user. If for any reason the Keycloak UI is not available for the administrator to verify the state of the user, using Keycloak\u0026rsquo;s kcadm.sh utility from the command line will be required.\nThe kcadm.sh utility is included with the Shasta Keycloak container image and can be used as described below to: * Perform troubleshooting operations that can verify the existence of a user. * Determine if a user is federated. * Change a user credential (for a keycloak-local account only). * Create a new local Keycloak user that is compatible (has the correct role mappings) with the Cray CLI.\nAll of the operations described below must be run as root from the ncn-m001 node.\nUsage of Bash functions provided below will require making additions to the Linux environment. This can be accomplished by pasting the function into the shell, or pasting the function into a file and then sourcing the file, before running the indicated function.\nTopics  Check the Status of a Keycloak User Update a Local Keycloak User Credential Create a Local Keycloak Cray CLI User Delete a Local Keycloak User  Check the Status of a Keycloak User This procedure determines whether or not a user exists in Keycloak and whether or not that user is LDAP federated.\nIf a user is LDAP federated and the credential is not known, then that user credential must be updated in LDAP.\nAdd the following Bash function to your environment:\nkc-find-user(){ # Note that filtering does not use exact matching.

The following procedures for managing sealed secrets are included in this section:\n Generate Sealed Secrets Post-Install Prevent Regeneration of Tracked Sealed Secrets View Tracked Sealed Secrets Decrypt Sealed Secrets for Review Fix an Incorrect Value in a Sealed Secret  In the following sections, the term \u0026ldquo;tracked sealed secrets\u0026rdquo; is used to describe any existing secrets stored in spec.kubernetes.tracked_sealed_secrets that are available to be regenerated.\nMany of the examples in this section assume the USB stick used to install the system is still available. If site-init is no longer available on the USB stick and a backup has not been made, a new site-init will need to be created following step 1 in the Generate Sealed Secrets Post-Install section.\nThe customizations.yaml file used in this procedure will be located in one of the following locations depending on the state of the system:\n Fresh install location: /mnt/pitdata/${CSM_DISTDIR}/shasta-cfg/customizations.yaml Post-install location: /root/site-init/${CSM_DISTDIR}/shasta-cfg/customizations.yaml  Generate Sealed Secrets Post-Install Sealed secrets are stored in customizations.yaml as SealedSecret resources (encrypted secrets), which are deployed by specific charts and decrypted by the sealed secrets operator. First, those secrets must be seeded, generated, and encrypted.\nThe steps in this section assume the USB stick is no longer available. If LDAP user federation is required, refer to Add LDAP User Federation.\n  Prepare to customize the customizations.yaml file.\nIf the customizations.yaml file is managed in an external Git repository (as recommended), then clone a local working tree.

The cfgsh tool is a configuration shell that can be used interactively or scripted. Interactively, it may be used as follows after logging in as root via ssh:\nx0c1# config x0c1(conf)# CURRENT_PASSWORD root NEW_PASSWORD x0c1(conf)# exit x0c1# copy running-config startup-config x0c1# exit It may be used non-interactively as well. This is useful for separating out several of the commands used for the initial setup. The shell utility returns non-zero on error.\n# cfgsh --config CURRENT_PASSWORD root NEW_PASSWORD # cfgsh copy running-config startup-config In both cases, a running-config must be saved out to non-volatile storage in a startup configuration file. If it is not, the password will revert to default on the next boot. This is the exact same behavior as standard managed Ethernet switches.\nSNMP Credentials To adjust the SNMP credentials, perform the following tasks:\n  Update the default credentials specified in the customizations.yaml file.\n See Update Default Air-Cooled BMC and Leaf-BMC Switch SNMP Credentials    Update the credentials actively being used for existing leaf switches.\n See Change SNMP Credentials on Leaf BMC Switches    HPE Cray EX Liquid-Cooled Cabinet Hardware Change the global default credential on HPE Cray EX liquid-cooled cabinet embedded controllers (BMCs).

This instance also serves as a general secrets engine for the system.\nKubernetes service account authorization is utilized to authenticate access to Vault. The configuration of Vault, as deployed on the system, can be viewed with the following command:\n# kubectl get vault -n vault cray-vault -o yaml A Kubernetes operator manages the deployment of Vault, based on this definition. The resulting instance will also be deployed to the vault namespace.\nIMPORTANT: Changing the cray-vault custom resource definition is not supported unless directed by customer support.\nFor more information, refer to the following resources:\n HashiCorp Vault https://banzaicloud.com/docs/bank-vaults/overview/ https://www.vaultproject.io/docs  Jetstack Cert-manager A deployment of Jetstack Cert-manager provides a Kubernetes-native API to request x.509 certificate and key management operations.\nCert-manager is integrated with HashiCorp Vault for use as a CA. Cert-manager generates key material and a certificate signing request (CSR), and then submits the CSR to Vault for signature. Once Vault has signed the certificate, it is made available, along with other key materials, via a Kubernetes Secret. Kubernetes pods or other platform aware components can then source the resulting secret.\nCert-manager will also automatically manage renewal of certificates prior to their expiration time. Cert-manager is deployed on the system using namespace-specific (certificate) issuers.\nTo view Issuers:\n# kubectl get issuer -A -o wide To view certificates:\n# kubectl get certificate -A -o wide Once a certificate is ready, the resulting secret will contain the following data fields:\n   Field Description     ca.crt Contains trusted CA certificates   tls.crt Contains the generated certificate, along with trusted CA certificates in the trust chain   tls.key Contains the private key    To view certificate signing requests:\n# kubectl get certificaterequest -A -o wide The Cert-manager workload is deployed to the cert-manager namespace.\nFor more information, refer to the following resources:\n https://cert-manager.io/docs/  TrustedCerts Operator The TrustedCerts Operator is an HPE Kubernetes Operator. It acts on the TrustedCertificates custom resource definitions. Its function is to source CA certificates via use of a Vault API, and then distribute them.\nTo see the deployed TrustedCertificates resources:\n# kubectl get trustedcertificates -A These resources can be used to further examine the ConfigMap and Boot Script Service (BSS) destination references.

Replace this name with the actual NCN\u0026rsquo;s DNS name while executing this procedure.\nProcedure   Log in to Keycloak with the default admin credentials.\nPoint a browser at https://auth.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/keycloak/admin, replacing SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME with the actual NCN\u0026rsquo;s DNS name.\nThe following is an example URL for a system: \u0026lsquo;auth.cmn.system1.us.cray.com/keycloak/admin`\nUse the following admin login credentials:\n Username: admin The password can be obtained with the following command:  ncn# kubectl get secret -n services keycloak-master-admin-auth \\  --template={{.data.password}} | base64 --decode   Click the Admin drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the page.\n  Select Manage Account.\n  Click the Password tab on the left side of the page.\n  Enter the existing password, new password and confirmation, and then click Save.\n  Log on to ncn-w001.\n  Run git clone https://github.com/Cray-HPE/csm.git.\n  Save a local copy of the customizations.yaml file.\nncn# kubectl get secrets -n loftsman site-init -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.customizations\\.yaml}\u0026#39; | base64 -d \u0026gt; customizations.yaml   Change the password in the customizations.yaml file.\nThe Keycloak master admin password is also stored in the keycloak-master-admin-auth Kubernetes Secret in the services namespace. This must be updated so that clients which need to make requests as the master admin can authenticate with the new password.\nIn the customizations.yaml file, set the values for the keycloak_master_admin_auth keys in the spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets field. The value in the data element where the name is password needs to be changed to the new Keycloak master admin password.

Generate the manifest that will be used to redeploy the chart with the modified resources.\nncn# manifestgen -c customizations.yaml -i platform.yaml -o manifest.yaml   Re-apply the cray-keycloak Helm chart with the updated customizations.yaml file.\nThis will update the keycloak-master-admin-auth SealedSecret which will cause the SealedSecret controller to update the Secret.\nncn# loftsman ship --charts-path ${PATH_TO_RELEASE}/helm --manifest-path ./manifest.yaml   Verify that the Secret has been updated.\nGive the SealedSecret controller a few seconds to update the Secret, then run the following command to see the current value of the Secret:\nncn# kubectl get secret -n services keycloak-master-admin-auth \\  --template={{.data.password}} | base64 --decode   Save an updated copy of customizations.yaml to the site-init secret in the loftsman Kubernetes namespace.\nncn# CUSTOMIZATIONS=$(base64 \u0026lt; customizations.yaml | tr -d \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) ncn# kubectl get secrets -n loftsman site-init -o json | jq \u0026#34;.data.\\\u0026#34;customizations.yaml\\\u0026#34; |= \\\u0026#34;$CUSTOMIZATIONS\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | kubectl apply -f -   "

This host certificate is used during the installation process to configure the API gateway for TLS so that communications to the gateway can use HTTPS.\nClients should use HTTPS to talk to services behind the API gateway and need to ensure that the NCN CA certificate is known by the client software when making requests.\nKeycloak, which is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) server, will also have a certificate created at install time for the Shasta realm. This certificate is known as the Shasta realm certificate and is used when signing a JSON Web Token (JWT). The Shasta realm certificate is registered with the API gateway and is used by the API gateway to validate that a JWT passed when requests are made actually originate from the IAM server.\nThis document does not cover the process for updating any of the certificates described below.\n  NCN CA certificate - The NCN CA is created by the installer and located at sms-1:/var/opt/cray/certificate_authority/certificate_authority.crt. The signature algorithm used is sha256WithRSAEncryption and the key length is 2048 bits. The CA Issuer is generated at the time of creation and therefore specific to each installation. This and other certificate details can be viewed from the NCN by executing:\n# openssl x509 -in /var/opt/cray/certificate_authority/certificate_authority.crt -noout -text   NCN host certificate - The NCN host certificate is created by the installer and located at sms-1:/var/opt/cray/certificate_authority/hosts/host.crt\nThe signature algorithm used is sha256WithRSAEncryption and the key length is 2048 bits. Additional certificate details can be viewed from the NCN by executing:\n# openssl x509 -in /var/opt/cray/certificate_authority/hosts/host.crt -noout -text   API Gateway TLS certificate - The API gateway is configured with the NCN host certificate and key to allow enabling TLS/HTTPS on the gateway. Configuration details are handled by the installer when the API gateway Kubernetes pods are created.\n  IAM Service Shasta realm JWT certificate - The IAM Service (Keycloak) Shasta realm contains an RSA certificate. This is known as the realm certificate. The realm certificate is used by the API gateway during JWT validation.\nThe installer adds a Shasta realm to the IAM service. The RSA realm certificate is created as part of that process. This certificate can be viewed from the Keycloak Admin Console by selecting the Shasta realm, then clicking on the Realm Settings link and then on the Keys tab. The certificate can be viewed by clicking the Public Key button for the RSA certificate. The key length is 2048 bits.\n  "

The script will immediately prompt for a new passphrase for ssh-keygen. The script will then proceed to unsquash the supplied squash files and then prompt for a password. Once the password of the last squash has been provided, the script will continue to completion without interruption. The process can be fully automated by using the SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH environment variable (see below) along with either -d or -N -a Do *not* modify the authorized_keys file in the squashfs. If modifying a previously modified image, or an authorized_keys file that contains the public key is already included in the directory used with the -d option, you may want to use this option. -d dir If provided, the contents will be copied into /root/.ssh/ in the squashfs image. Do not supply ssh-keygen arguments when using -d. Assumes public keys have a .pub extension. -p Change or set the password in the squashfs. By default, the user prompted to enter the password after each squashfs file is unsquashed. Use the SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH environment variable (see below) to change or set the password without being prompted. -z timezone By default the timezone on NCNs is UTC. Use this option to override. SUPPORTED SSH-KEYGEN ARGUMENTS The following ssh-keygen(1) arguments are supported by this script: [-b bits] [-t dsa | ecdsa | ecdsa-sk | ed25519 | ed25519-sk | rsa] [-N new_passphrase] [-C comment] ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH If set to the encrypted hash for a root password, this hash will be injected into /etc/shadow in the squashfs image and there will be no interactive prompt to set it. When setting this variable, be sure to use single quotes (\u0026#39;) to ensure any \u0026#39;$\u0026#39; characters are not interpreted. DEBUG If set, the script will be run with \u0026#39;set -x\u0026#39; Example:\nncn-m# ncn-image-modification.sh -z Americas/Chicago \\  -k k8s/${K8SVERSION}/filesystem.squashfs \\  -s ceph/${CEPHVERSION}/filesystem.squashfs \\  -d ~/.ssh/ In the above example, the timezone in the squashfs is being changed to Americas/Chicago. The root password will not be changed because -p was not provided on the command line. It will copy the existing keys in ~/.ssh/ into the image.\nExample:\nncn-m# export SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH=$(awk -F\u0026#39;:\u0026#39; /^root:/\u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; \u0026lt; /etc/shadow) ncn-m# ncn-image-modification.sh -p -t rsa \\  -N \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \\  -k k8s/${K8SVERSION}/filesystem.squashfs \\  -s ceph/${CEPHVERSION}/filesystem.squashfs In this example the root password hash in /etc/shadow in the NCN image will be replaced with the contents of the $SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH variable. Ensure single quotes are used when setting the environment variable so that any $ characters are not interpreted by Bash. In the example above, SQUASHFS_ROOT_PW_HASH is being set to match the root password hash that exists on the current node. This invocation also creates new SSH keys.\nThe newly created images will have a secure- prefix.

The password for the JKS file must be password.\nAdministrators may use the keytool command from the openjdk:11-jre-slim container image packaged with CSM to create a JKS file that includes a PEM-encoded CA certificate to verify the LDAP host(s).\n  Load the openjdk container image.\n NOTE: Requires a properly configured Docker or Podman environment.\n ncn-m001# ${CSM_DISTDIR}/hack/load-container-image.sh dtr.dev.cray.com/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim Troubleshooting:\n  If the output shows the skopeo.tar file cannot be found, then ensure that the $CSM_DISTDIR directory looks contains the dtr.dev.cray.com directory which includes the originally installed docker images.\nThe following is an example of the skopeo.tar file not being found:\n++ podman load -q -i ./hack/../vendor/skopeo.tar ++ sed -e \u0026#39;s/^.*: //\u0026#39; + SKOPEO_IMAGE=   If the following overlay error is returned, it could be caused by an earlier podman invocation using a different configuration:\n\u0026quot;ERRO[0000] [graphdriver] prior storage driver overlay failed: 'overlay' is not supported over overlayfs, a mount_program is required: backing file system is unsupported for this graph driver\u0026quot; To recover podman, move the overlay directories to a backup folder as follows:\nncn-m001# mkdir /var/lib/containers/storage/backup ncn-m001# mv /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay* /var/lib/containers/storage/backup This should allow load-container-images.sh to succeed.\n    Create (or update) cert.jks with the PEM-encoded CA certificate for an LDAP host.\n IMPORTANT: Replace \u0026lt;ca-cert.pem\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; before running the command.\n ncn-m001# podman run --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd):/data\u0026#34; dtr.dev.cray.com/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim keytool \\  -importcert -trustcacerts -file /data/\u0026lt;ca-cert.pem\u0026gt; -alias \u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; -keystore /data/certs.jks \\  -storepass password -noprompt   Set variables for the LDAP server.\nIn the following example, the LDAP server has the hostname dcldap2.us.cray.com and is using the port 636.\nncn-m001# export LDAP=dcldap2.us.cray.com ncn-m001# export PORT=636   Get the issuer certificate for the LDAP server at port 636. Use openssl s_client to connect and show the certificate chain returned by the LDAP host.\nncn-m001# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $LDAP:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null   Generate cacert.pem containing the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate.\nEither manually extract (cut/paste) the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate into cacert.pem, or try the following commands to create it automatically.\n NOTE: The following commands were verified using OpenSSL version 1.1.1d and use the -nameopt RFC2253 option to ensure consistent formatting of distinguished names (DNs). Unfortunately, older versions of OpenSSL may not support -nameopt on the s_client command or may use a different default format. As a result, mileage may vary; however, administrators should be able to extract the issuer certificate manually from the output of the above openssl s_client example if the following commands are unsuccessful.\n   Observe the issuer\u0026rsquo;s DN.\nFor example:\nncn-m001# openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect $LDAP:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | grep issuer= | sed -e \u0026#39;s/^issuer=//\u0026#39; emailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US   Extract the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate using the awk command.\n NOTE: The issuer DN is properly escaped as part of the awk pattern below. If the value being used is different, be sure to escape it properly!\n ncn-m001# openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect $LDAP:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | awk \u0026#39;/s:emailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC\\/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US/,/END CERTIFICATE/\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/\u0026#39; \u0026gt; cacert.pem     Verify the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate was properly extracted and saved in cacert.pem.\nncn-m001# cat cacert.pem Expected output looks similar to the following:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDvTCCAqWgAwIBAgIUYxrG/PrMcmIzDuJ+U1Gh8hpsU8cwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQAwbjELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxCzAJBgNVBAgMAldJMQwwCgYDVQQKDANIUEUxEDAO BgNVBAsMB0hQQy9NQ1MxFDASBgNVBAMMC0RhdGEgQ2VudGVyMRwwGgYJKoZIhvcN AQkBFg1kY29wc0BocGUuY29tMB4XDTIwMTEyNDIwMzM0MVoXDTMwMTEyMjIwMzM0 MVowbjELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxCzAJBgNVBAgMAldJMQwwCgYDVQQKDANIUEUxEDAO BgNVBAsMB0hQQy9NQ1MxFDASBgNVBAMMC0RhdGEgQ2VudGVyMRwwGgYJKoZIhvcN AQkBFg1kY29wc0BocGUuY29tMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKC AQEAuBIZkKitHHVQHymtaQt4D8ZhG4qNJ0cTsLhODPMtVtBjPZp59e+PWzbc9Rj5 +wfjLGteK6/fNJsJctWlS/ar4jw/xBIPMk5pg0dnkMT2s7lkSCmyd9Uib7u6y6E8 yeGoGcb7I+4ZI+E3FQV7zPact6b17xmajNyKrzhBGEjYucYJUL5iTgZ6a7HOZU2O aQSXe7ctiHBxe7p7RhHCuKRrqJnxoohakloKwgHHzDLFQzX/5ADp1hdJcduWpaXY RMBu6b1mhmwo5vmc+fDnfUpl5/X4i109r9VN7JC7DQ5+JX8u9SHDGLggBWkrhpvl bNXMVCnwnSFfb/rnmGO7rdJSpwIDAQABo1MwUTAdBgNVHQ4EFgQUVg3VYExUAdn2 WE3e8Xc8HONy/+4wHwYDVR0jBBgwFoAUVg3VYExUAdn2WE3e8Xc8HONy/+4wDwYD VR0TAQH/BAUwAwEB/zANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFAAOCAQEAWLDQLB6rrmK+gwUY+4B7 0USbQK0JkLWuc0tCfjTxNQTzFb75PeH+GH21QsjUI8VC6QOAAJ4uzIEV85VpOQPp qjz+LI/Ej1xXfz5ostZQu9rCMnPtVu7JT0B+NV7HvgqidTfa2M2dw9yUYS2surZO 8S0Dq3Bi6IEhtGU3T8ZpbAmAp+nNsaJWdUNjD4ECO5rAkyA/Vu+WyMz6F3ZDBmRr ipWM1B16vx8rSpQpygY+FNX4e1RqslKhoyuzXfUGzyXux5yhs/ufOaqORCw3rJIx v4sTWGsSBLXDsFM3lBgljSAHfmDuKdO+Qv7EqGzCRMpgSciZihnbQoRrPZkOHUxr NA== -----END CERTIFICATE-----   Create certs.jks.\nncn-m001# podman run --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd):/data\u0026#34; dtr.dev.cray.com/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim keytool -importcert \\  -trustcacerts -file /data/cacert.pem -alias cray-data-center-ca -keystore /data/certs.jks \\  -storepass password -noprompt   Create certs.jks.b64 by base-64 encoding certs.jks.\nncn-m001# base64 certs.jks \u0026gt; certs.jks.b64   Inject and encrypt certs.jks.b64 into customizations.yaml.\nncn-m001# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | yq w - \u0026#39;data.\u0026#34;certs.jks\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$(\u0026lt;certs.jks.b64)\u0026#34; | yq r -j - | /root/site-init/utils/secrets-encrypt.sh | yq w -f - -i /root/site-init/customizations.yaml \\ spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray-keycloak { \u0026#34;kind\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Secret\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;keycloak-certs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;services\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;creationTimestamp\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: {} } EOF     Upload the modified customizations.yaml file to Kubernetes.\nncn-m001# kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init ncn-m001# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml   Prepare to generate sealed secrets.\nSecrets are stored in customizations.yaml as SealedSecret resources (encrypted secrets), which are deployed by specific charts and decrypted by the sealed secrets operator.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Resilience of System Management Services HPE Cray EX systems are designed so that system management services (SMS) are fully resilient and that there is no single point of failure. The design of the system allows for resiliency in the following ways:\n Three non-compute nodes (NCNs) are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. When one master goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes. When one of the utility storage nodes goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three NCNs are configured as Kubernetes worker nodes. If one of only three Kubernetes worker nodes were to go down, it would be much more difficult for the remaining two NCN worker nodes to handle the total balance of pods. It is less significant to lose one of the NCN worker nodes if the system has more than three NCN worker nodes because there are more worker nodes able to handle the pod load. The state and configuration of the Kubernetes cluster are stored in an etcd cluster distributed across the Kubernetes master nodes. This cluster is also backed up on an interval, and backups are pushed to Ceph Rados Gateway (S3). A micro-service can run on any node that meets the requirements for that micro-service, such as appropriate hardware attributes, which are indicated by labels and taints. All micro-services have shared persistent storage so that they can be restarted on any NCN in the Kubernetes management cluster without losing state.  Kubernetes is designed to ensure that the wanted number of deployments of a micro-service are always running on one or more worker nodes. In addition, it ensures that if one worker node becomes unresponsive, the micro-services that were running on it are migrated to another NCN that is up and meets the requirements of those micro-services.\nSee Restore System Functionality if a Kubernetes Worker Node is Down for more information.\nResiliency Improvements To increase the overall resiliency of system management services and software within the system, the following improvements were made:\n Capsules services have implemented replicas for added resiliency. Added support for new storage class that supports Read-Write-Many and in doing so, eliminated some of the errors we encountered on pods which could not seamlessly start up on other worker NCNs upon termination (because of a PVC unmount error). Modified procedures for reloading DVS on NCNs to reduce DVS service interruptions. DVS now retries DNS queries in dvs_generate_map, which improves boot resiliency at scale. Additional retries implemented in the BOA, IMS, and CFS services for increased protection around outages of dependent services. Image-based installs emphasizing \u0026ldquo;non-special\u0026rdquo; node types eliminated single points of failure previously encountered with DNS, administrative and installation tooling, and gathering of Cray System Management (CSM) logging for Ceph and Kubernetes.  Expected Resiliency Behavior In addition, the following general criteria describe the expected behavior of the system if a single Kubernetes node (master, worker, or storage) goes down temporarily:\n  Once a job has been launched and is executing on the compute plane, it is expected that it will continue to run without interruption during planned or unplanned outages characterized by the loss of an NCN master, worker, or storage node. Applications launched through PALS may show error messages and lost output if a worker node goes down during application runtime.\n  If an NCN worker node goes down, it will take between 4 and 5 minutes before most of the pods which had been running on the downed NCN will begin terminating. This is a predefined Kubernetes behavior, not something inherent to HPE Cray EX.\n  Within around 20 minutes or less, it should be possible to launch a job using a UAI or UAN after planned or unplanned outages characterized by the loss of an NCN master, worker, or storage node.\n In the case of a UAN, the recovery time is expected to be quicker. However, launching a UAI after an NCN outage means that some UAI pods may need to relocate to other NCN worker nodes. The status of those new UAI pods will remain unready until all necessary content has been loaded on the new NCN that the UAI is starting up on. This process can take approximately 10 minutes.    Within around 20 minutes or less, it should be possible to boot and configure compute nodes after planned or unplanned outages characterized by the loss of an NCN master, worker, or storage node.\n  At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes. When one of the utility storage nodes goes down, critical operations such as job launch, application run, or compute node boot are expected to continue to work.\n  Not all pods running on a downed NCN worker node are expected to migrate to a remaining NCN worker node. There are some pods which are configured with anti-affinity such that if the pod exists on another NCN worker node, it will not start another of those pods on that same NCN worker node. At this time, this mostly only applies to etcd clusters running in the cluster. It is optimal to have those pods balanced across the NCN worker nodes (and not have multiple etcd pods, from the same etcd cluster, running on the same NCN worker node). Thus, when an NCN worker node goes down, the etcd pods running on it will remain in terminated state and will not attempt to relocate to another NCN worker node. This should be fine as there should be at least two other etcd pods (from the cluster of 3) running on other NCN worker nodes. Additionally, any pods that are part of a stateful set will not migrate off a worker node when it goes down. Those are expected to stay on the node and also remain in the terminated state until the NCN worker nodes comes back up or unless deliberate action is taken to force that pod off the NCN worker node which is down.\n The cps-cm-pm pods are part of a daemonset and they only run on designated nodes. When the node comes back up the containers will be restarted and service restored. Refer to \u0026ldquo;Content Projection Service (CPS)\u0026rdquo; in the Cray Operating System (COS) product stream documentation for more information on changing node assignments.    After an NCN worker, storage, or master node goes down, if there are issues with launching a UAI session or booting compute nodes, that does not necessarily mean that the problem is due to a worker node being down. If possible, it is advised to also check the relevant \u0026ldquo;Compute Node Boot Troubleshooting Information\u0026rdquo; and User Access Service (specifically with respect to Troubleshoot UAS Issues) procedures. Those sections can give guidance around general known issues and how to troubleshoot them. For any customer support ticket opened on these issues, however, it would be an important piece of data to include in that ticket if the issue was encountered while one or more of the NCNs were down.\n  Known Issues and Workarounds Though an effort was made to increase the number of pod replicas for services that were critical to system operations such as booting computes, launching jobs, and running applications across the compute plane, there are still some services that remain with single copies of their pods. In general, this does not result in a critical issue if these singleton pods are on an NCN worker node that goes down. Most micro-services should (after being terminated by Kubernetes), simply be rescheduled onto a remaining NCN worker node. That assumes that the remaining NCN worker nodes have sufficient resources available and meet the hardware/network requirements of the pods.\nHowever, it is important to note that some pods, when running on a worker NCN that goes down, may require some manual intervention to be rescheduled. Note the workarounds in this section for such pods. Work is ongoing to correct these issues in a future release.\n  Nexus pod\n The nexus pod is a single pod deployment and serves as our image repository. If it is on an NCN worker node that goes down, it will attempt to start up on another NCN worker node. However, it is likely that it can also encounter the Multi-Attach error for volume error that can be seen in the kubectl describe output for the pod that is trying to come up on the new node.    To determine if this is happening, run the following:\nncn# kubectl get pods -n nexus | grep nexus   Describe the pod obtained in the previous step\nncn# kubectl describe pod -n nexus NEXUS_FULL_POD_NAME   If the event data at the bottom of the kubectl describe command output indicates that a Multi-Attach PVC error has occurred, then see the Troubleshoot Pods Multi-Attach Error procedure to unmount the PVC. This will allow the Nexus pod to begin successfully running on the new NCN worker node.\n    High-speed network resiliency after ncn-w001 goes down\n  The slingshot-fabric-manager pod running on one of NCNs does not rely on ncn-w001. If ncn-w001 goes down, the slingshot-fabric-manager pods should not be impacted as the pod is runs on other NCNs, such as ncn-w002.\n  The slingshot-fabric-manager pod relies on Kubernetes to launch the new pod on another NCN if the slingshot-fabric-manager pod is running on ncn-w001 when it is brought down.\nUse the following command and check the NODE column to check which NCN the pod is running on:\nncn# kubectl get pod -n services -o wide | awk \u0026#39;NR == 1 || /slingshot-fabric-manager/\u0026#39;   When the slingshot-fabric-manager pod goes down, the switches will continue to run. Even if the status of the switches changes, those changes will be picked up after the slingshot-fabric-manager pod is brought back up and the sweeping process restarts.\n  The slingshot-fabric-manager relies on data in persistent storage. The data is persistent across upgrades but when the pods are deleted, the data is also deleted.\n    Future Resiliency Improvements In a future release, strides will be made to further improve the resiliency of the system. These improvements may include one or more of the following:\n Further emphasis on eliminating singleton system management pods. Reduce time delays for individual service responsiveness after its pods are terminated because of it running on a worker node that has gone down. Rebalancing of pods/workloads after an NCN worker node comes back up after being down. Analysis/improvements with respect to outages of the Node Management Network (NMN) and the impact to critical system management services. Expanded analysis/improvements of resiliency of noncritical services (those that are not directly related to job launch, application run, or compute boot).  "

	"content": "Resiliency Testing Procedure This document and the procedures contained within it are for the purposes of communicating the kind of testing done by the internal Cray System Management (CSM) team to ensure a basic level of system resiliency in the event of the loss of a single non-compute node (NCN).\nIt is assumed that some procedures are already known by admins and thus does not go into great detail or attempt to encompass every command necessary for execution. It is intended to be higher level guidance (with some command examples) to inform internal users and customers about our process.\nHigh Level Procedure Summary  Prepare for Resiliency Testing Establish System Health Before Beginning Monitor for Changes Launch a Non-Interactive Batch Job Shut Down an NCN Conduct Testing Power on the Downed NCN Execute Post-Boot Health Checks  Prepare for Resiliency Testing   Confirm the component name (xname) mapping for each node on the system. This get dumped out by execution of the /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnGetXnames.sh script.\n  Verify that metal.no-wipe=1 is set for each of the NCNs using output from running the ncnGetXnames.sh script.\n  Ensure the user account in use is an authorized user on the Cray CLI.\nLog in as a user account where the credentials are known:\nncn# export CRAY_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d); echo $CRAY_CONFIG_DIR; cray init --configuration default --hostname https://api-gw-service-nmn.local /tmp/tmp.ShkBrUfhsJ Username: username Password: Success! Then, validate the authorization by executing the cray uas list command, for example. For more information, see the Validate UAI Creation section of Validate CSM Health.\n  Verify that kubectl get nodes reports all master and worker nodes are Ready.\nncn# kubectl get nodes -o wide   Get a current list of pods that have a status of anything other than Running or Completed. Investigate any of concern. Save the list of pods for comparison once resiliency testing is completed and the system has been restored.\nncn# kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep -Ev \u0026#39;Running|Completed\u0026#39;   Note which pods are running on an NCN that will be taken down (as well as the total number of pods running). The following is an example that shows the listing of pods running on ncn-w001:\nncn# kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep ncn-w001 | awk \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; Note that the above would only apply to Kubernetes nodes, such as master and worker nodes (ncn-m00x and ncn-w00x).\n  Verify ipmitool can report power status for the NCN to be shutdown.\nncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -P \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -H \u0026lt;ncn-node-name\u0026gt; chassis power status If ncn-m001 is the node to be brought down, note that it has the external network connection. Therefore it is important to establish that ipmitool commands are able to be run from a node external to the system, in order to get the power status of ncn-m001.\n  If ncn-m001 is the node to take down, establish Customer Access Network (CAN) links to bypass ncn-m001 (because it will be down) in order to enable an external connection to one of the other master NCNs before, during, and after ncn-m001 is brought down.\n  Verify Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) templates and create a new one(s) if needed (to be set-up for booting a specific compute node(s) after the targeted NCN has been shutdown).\nAhead of shutting down the NCN and beginning resiliency testing, verify that compute nodes identified for reboot validation can be successfully rebooted and configured.\nTo see a list of BOS templates that exist on the system:\nncn# cray bos sessiontemplate list For more information regarding management of BOS session templates, refer to Manage a Session Template.\n  If a UAN is present on the system, log onto it and verify that the workload manager (WLM) is configured by running a command.\nThe following is an example for Slurm:\nuan# srun -N 4 hostname | sort   Establish System Health Before Beginning In order to ensure that the system is healthy before taking an NCN node down, run the Platform Health Checks section of Validate CSM Health.\nIf health issues are noted, it is best to address those before proceeding with the resiliency testing procedure. If it is believed (in the case of an internal Cray-HPE testing environment) that the issue is known/understood and will not impact the testing to be performed, then those health issues just need to be noted (so that it does not appear that they were caused by inducing the fault, in this case, powering off the NCN). There is an optional section of the platform health validation that deals with using the System Management monitoring tools to survey system health. If that optional validation is included, please note that the prometheus alert manager may show various alerts that would not prevent or block moving forward with this testing. For more information about Prometheus alerts (and some that can be safely ignored), reference Troubleshooting Prometheus Alerts.\nPart of the data being returned via execution of the Platform Health Checks includes patronictl info for each Postgres cluster. Each of the Postgres clusters has a leader pod, and in the case of a resiliency test that involves bringing an NCN worker node down, it may be useful to take note of the Postgres clusters that have their leader pods running on the NCN worker targeted for shutdown. The postgres-operator should handle re-establishment of a leader on another pod running in the cluster, but it is worth taking note of where leader re-elections are expected to occur so special attention can be given to those Postgres clusters. The Postgres health check is included in Validate CSM Health, but the script for dumping Postgres data can be run at any time:\nncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnPostgresHealthChecks.sh Monitor for Changes In order to keep watch on various items during and after the fault has been introduced (in this case, the shutdown of a single NCN node), the steps listed below can help give insight into changing health conditions. It is an eventual goal to strive for a monitoring dashboard which would help track these sort of things in a single or few automated views. Until that can be incorporated, these kinds of command prompt sessions can be useful.\n  Set up a watch command to repeatedly run with the Cray CLI (that will hit the service API) to ensure that critical services can ride through a fault. Note that there is not more than a window of 5-10 minutes where a service would, intermittently, fail to respond.\nIn the examples below, the CLI commands are checking the bos and cps APIs. It may be desired to choose additional Cray CLI commands to run in this manner. The ultimate proof of system resiliency lies in the ability to perform system level use cases and to, further, prove that can be done at scale. If there are errors being returned, consistently (and without recovery), with respect to these commands, it is likely that business critical use cases (that utilize the same APIs) will also fail.\nIt may be useful to reference instructions for Configuring the Cray CLI.\nncn# watch -n 5 \u0026#34;date; cray cps contents\u0026#34; ncn# watch -n 5 \u0026#34;date; cray bos session list\u0026#34;   Monitor Ceph health, in a window, during and after a single NCN is taken down.\nncn# watch -n 5 \u0026#34;date; ceph -s\u0026#34;   Identify when pods on a downed master or worker NCN are no longer responding.\nThis takes around 5-6 minutes, and Kubernetes will begin terminating pods so that new pods to replace them can start-up on another NCN. Pods that had been running on the downed NCN will remain in Terminated state until the NCN is back up. Pods that need to start-up on other nodes will be Pending until they start-up. Some pods that have anti-affinity configurations or that run as daemonsets will not be able to start up on another NCN. Those pods will remain in Pending state until the NCN is back up.\nFinally, it is helpful to have a window tracking the list of pods that are not in Completed or Running state to be able to determine how that list is changing once the NCN is downed and pods begin shifting around. This step offers a view of what is going on at the time that the NCN is brought down and once Kubernetes detects an issue and begins remediation. It is not so important to capture everything that is happening during this step. It may be helpful for debugging. The output of these windows/commands becomes more interesting once the NCN is down for a period of time and then it is brought back up. At that point, the expectation is that everything can recover.\nRun the following commands in separate windows:\nncn# watch -n 5 \u0026#34;date; kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep Termin\u0026#34; ncn# watch -n 10 \u0026#34;date; kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep Pending\u0026#34; ncn# watch -n 5 \u0026#34;date; kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep -v Completed | grep -v Running\u0026#34;   Detect the change in state of the various Postgres instances running.\nRun the following in a separate window:\nncn# watch -n 30 \u0026#34;date; kubectl get postgresql -A\u0026#34; If Postgres reports a status that deviates from Running, that would require further investigation and possibly remediation via Troubleshooting the Postgres Database.\n  Launch a Non-Interactive Batch Job The purpose of this procedure is to launch a non-interactive, long-running batch job across computes via a UAI (or the UAN, if present) in order to ensure that even though the UAI pod used to launch the job is running on the NCN worker node being taken down, it will start up on another NCN worker (once Kubernetes begins terminating pods).\nAdditionally, it is important to verify that the batch job continued to run, uninterrupted through that process. If the target NCN for shutdown is not a worker node (where a UAI would be running), then there is no need to pay attention to the steps, below, that discuss ensuring the UAI can only be created on the NCN worker node that is targeted for shutdown. If executing a shut down of a master or storage NCN, the procedure can begin at creating a UAI. It is still good to ensure that non-interactive batch jobs are uninterrupted, even with the UAI they are launched from is not being disrupted.\nLaunch on a UAI   Create a UAI.\nTo create a UAI, see the Validate UAI Creation section of Validate CSM Health and/or Create a UAI.\nIf the target node for shutdown is a worker NCN, force the UAI to be created on target worker NCN with the following steps:\n  Create labels to ensure that UAI pods will only be able to start-up on the target worker NCN.\nIn this example, ncn-w002 is the target node for shutdown on a system with only three NCN worker nodes.\nncn# kubectl label node ncn-w001 uas=False --overwrite ncn# kubectl label node ncn-w003 uas=False --overwrite If successful, output similar to node/ncn-w00X labeled will be returned.\n  Verify the labels were applied successfully.\nncn# kubectl get nodes -l uas=False Example output:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 4d19h v1.18.2 ncn-w003 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 4d19h v1.18.2   Remove the labels set above after the UAI has been created.\n IMPORTANT: After a UAI has been created, labels must be cleared or else when Kubernetes terminates the running UAI on the NCN being shut down, it will not be able to reschedule the UAI on another pod.\n ncn# kubectl label node ncn-w001 uas- ncn# kubectl label node ncn-w003 uas-     Verify that WLM is configured with the appropriate workload manager within the created UAI.\n  Verify the connection string of the created UAI.\nncn# cray uas list Example output:\n[[results]] uai_age = \u0026quot;2m\u0026quot; uai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh vers@10.103.8.170\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w002\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-cos-2.1.70:latest\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;10.103.8.170\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;uai-vers-f8fa541f\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Running: Ready\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;vers\u0026quot;   Log in to the created UAI.\nFor example:\nncn# ssh vers@10.103.8.170   Verify the configuration of Slurm, for example, within the UAI:\nvers@uai-vers-f8fa541f-5c5c9f5b75-vsb2k:/lus\u0026gt; srun -N 4 hostname | sort Example output:\nnid000001 nid000002 nid000003 nid000004     Copy an MPI application source and WLM batch job files to the UAI.\n  Compile an MPI application with the UAI. Launch application as batch job (not interactive) on compute node(s) that have not been designated, already, for reboots once an NCN is shut down.\n  Verify that batch job is running and that application output is streaming to a file. Streaming output will be used to verify that the batch job is still running during resiliency testing. A batch job, when submitted, will designate a log file location. This log file can be accessed to be able to verify that the batch job is continuing to run after an NCN is brought down and once it is back online. Additionally, the squeue command can be used to verify that the job continues to run (for Slurm).\n  Delete the UAI session when all of the testing is complete.\nncn# cray uas delete --uai-list uai-vers-f8fa541f     Launch on a UAN   Login to the UAN and verify that a WLM has been properly configured.\nIn this example, Slurm will be used.\nuan01# srun -N 4 hostname | sort Example output:\nnid000001 nid000002 nid000003 nid000004   Copy an MPI application source and WLM batch job files to UAN.\n  Compile an MPI application within the UAN. Launch the application as interactive on compute node(s)that have not been designated, already, for either reboots (once an NCN is shut down) or that are not already running an MPI job via a UAI.\n  Verify that the job launched on the UAN is running and that application output is streaming to a file. Streaming output will be used to verify that the batch job is still running during resiliency testing. A batch job, when submitted, will designate a log file location. This log file can be accessed to be able to verify that the batch job is continuing to run after an NCN is brought down and once it is back online. Additionally, the squeue command can be used to verify that the job continues to run (for Slurm).\n  Shut Down an NCN   Establish a console session to the NCN targeted for shutdown by executing the steps in Establish a Serial Connection to NCNs.\n  Log onto the target node and execute /sbin/shutdown -h 0.\n  Take note of the timestamp of the power off in the target node\u0026rsquo;s console output.\n  Once the target node is reported as being powered off, verify that the node\u0026rsquo;s power status with the ipmitool is reported as off.\nncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -P \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -H \u0026lt;ncn-node-name\u0026gt; chassis power status NOTE: In previous releases, an ipmitool command has been used to simply yank the power to an NCN. There have been times where this resulted in a longer recovery procedure under Shasta 1.5 (mostly due to issues with getting nodes physically booted up again), so the preference has been to simply use the shutdown command.\nIf the NCN shutdown is a master or worker node, within 5-6 minutes of the node being shut down, Kubernetes will begin reporting Terminating pods on the target node and start rescheduling pods to other NCN nodes. New pending pods will be created for pods that can not be relocated off of the NCN shut down. Pods reported as Terminating will remain in that state until the NCN has been powered back up.\n    Take note of changes in the data being reported out of the many monitoring windows that were set-up in a previous step.\n  Conduct Testing After the target NCN was shut down, assuming the command line windows that were set-up for ensuring API responsiveness are not encountering persistent failures, the next step will be to use a BOS template to boot a pre-designated set of compute nodes. The timing of this test is recommended to be around 10 minutes after the NCN has gone down. That should give ample time for Kubernetes to have terminated pods on the downed node (in the case of a master or worker NCN) and for them to have been rescheduled and in a healthy state on another NCN. Going too much earlier than 10 minutes runs the risk that there are still some critical pods that are settling out to reach a healthy state.\n  Reboot a pre-designated set of compute node(s) and watch the reboot.\n  Use BOS to reboot the designated compute node(s).\nncn# cray bos session create --template-uuid boot-nids-1-4 --operation reboot Issuing this reboot command will spit out a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) \u0026ldquo;jobId\u0026rdquo;, which can be used to find the new BOA pod that has been created for the boot. Then, the logs can be tailed to watch the compute boot proceed.\n  Find the BOA job name using the returned BOA \u0026ldquo;jobID\u0026rdquo;.\nncn# kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep \u0026lt;boa-job-id\u0026gt;   Watch the progress of the reboot of the compute(s).\nncn# kubectl logs -n services \u0026lt;boa-job-pod-name\u0026gt; -c boa -f Failures or a timeout being reached in either the boot or CFS (post-boot configuration) phase will need investigation. For more information around accessing logs for the BOS operations, see Check the Progress of BOS Session Operations.\n    If the target node for shutdown was a worker NCN, verify that the UAI launched on that node still exists. It should be running on another worker NCN.\n Any prior SSH session established with the UAI while it was running on the downed NCN worker node will be unresponsive. A new SSH session will need to be established once the UAI pods has been successfully relocated to another worker NCN. Log back into the UAI and verify that the WLM batch job is still running and streaming output. The log file created with the kick-off of the batch job should still be accessible and the squeue command can be used to verify that the job continues to run (for Slurm).    If the WLM batch job was launched on a UAN, log back into it and verify that the batch job is still running and streaming output via the log file created with the batch job and/or the squeue command (if Slurm is used as the WLM).\n  Verify that new WLM jobs can be started on a compute node after the NCN is down (either via a UAI or the UAN node).\n  Look at any pods that, are at this point, in a state other than Running, Completed, Pending, or Terminating:\nncn# kubectl get pods -o wide -A | grep -Ev \u0026#34;Running|Completed|Pending|Termin\u0026#34; Compare what comes up in this list to the pod list that was collected before. If there are new pods that are in status ImagePullBackOff or CrashLoopBackOff, a kubectl describe as well as kubectl logs command should be run against them to collect additional data about what happened. Obviously, if there were pods in a bad state before the procedure started, then it should not be expected that bringing one of the NCNs down is going to fix that.\nIgnore anything that was already in a bad state before (that was deemed to be ok). It is also worth taking note of any pods in a bad state at this stage as this should be checked again after bringing the NCN back up - to see if those pods remain in a bad state or if they are cleared. Noting behaviors, collecting logs, and opening tickets throughout this process is recommended when behavior occurs that is not expected. When we see an issue that has not been encountered before, it may not be immediately clear if code changes/regressions are at fault or if it is simply an intermittent/timing kind of issue that has not previously surfaced. The recommendation at that point, given time/resources is to repeat the test to gain a sense of the repeatability of the behavior (in the case that the issue is not directly tied to a code-change).\nAdditionally, it is as important to understand (and document) any work-around procedures needed to fix issues encountered. In addition to filing a bug for a permanent fix, work-around documentation can be very useful when written up - for both internal and external customers to access.\n  Power on the Downed NCN   Use the ipmitool command to power up the NCN.\nIt will take several minutes for the NCN to reboot. Progress can be monitored over the connected serial console session. Wait to begin execution of the next steps until after it can be determined that the NCN has booted up and is back at the login prompt (when viewing the serial console log).\nncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -P \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; -H \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; chassis power on #example hostname is ncn-w003-mgmt Check the following depending on the NCN type powered on:\n If the NCN being powered on is a master or worker, verify that Terminating pods on that NCN clear up. It may take several minutes. Watch the command prompt, previously set-up, that is displaying the Terminating pod list. If the NCN being powered on is a storage node, wait for Ceph to recover and again report a \u0026ldquo;HEALTH_OK\u0026rdquo; status. It may take several minutes for Ceph to resolve clock skew. This can be noted in the previously set-up window to watch Ceph status.    Check that pod statuses have returned to the state that they were in at the beginning of this procedure, paying particular attention to any pods that were previously noted to be in a bad state while the NCN was down. Additionally, there is no concern if pods that were in a bad state at the beginning of the procedure, are still in a bad state. What is important to note is anything that is different from either the beginning of the test or from the time that the NCN was down.\n  Execute Post-Boot Health Checks   Re-run the Platform Health Checks section of Validate CSM Health noting any output that indicates output is not as expected. Note that in a future version of CSM, these checks will be further automated for better efficiency and pass/fail clarity.\n  Ensure that after a downed NCN worker node (can ignore if not a worker node) has been powered up, a new UAI can be created on that NCN. It may be necessary to label the nodes again, to ensure the UAI gets created on the worker node that was just powered on. Refer to the section above for Launch a Non-Interactive Batch Job for the procedure.\n IMPORTANT: Do not forget to remove the labels after the UAI has been created. Once the UAI has been created, log into it and ensure a new workload manager job can be launched.\n   Ensure tickets have been opened for any unexpected behavior along with associated logs and notes on workarounds, if any were executed.\n  "

	"content": "Fresh Install: Setting NodeBMC and RouterBMC Redfish Credentials These steps are performed before the installation of Shasta System Management or HPCM management software stacks. The goal is to set the BMC Redfish credentials to values that the management software will be expecting so that all software systems work smoothly with the Redfish hardware.\nPrerequisites Before doing these operations, the following is assumed:\n There is a workstation or laptop which can access all target BMCs. Workstation or laptop has the curl command installed. The hostname or IP address of each BMC is known or obtainable. The default BMC password is obtainable for each target BMC.  Set BMC Passwords on All Air-Cooled BMC Hardware This involves interaction with the BMC hardware itself.\nThe BMC factory-default passwords are found on a sticker or card associated with the blades themselves. Some blade enclosures also have a chassis-level management controller (CMC) which may also have its own default password, which would need to be changed as well.\nThe procedure for each blade is to obtain the factory-default password for each blade\u0026rsquo;s BMC, and then use curl to set the root BMC account password to the desired password (which must match the one set in customizations.yaml).\nEach Redfish BMC will have at least one \u0026ldquo;account\u0026rdquo;, and often several accounts. Each account has an ordinal number, and only one of the accounts is the root account. This account is the one that must have its password changed.\nProcedure Use the following procedure for each BMC:\n  Get the default BMC password and the hostname or IP address of the BMC.\n  Determine which Redfish account is the root account:\nlinux# curl -s -k -u root:\u0026lt;DFLTPW\u0026gt; https://\u0026lt;BLADENAME_OR_IP\u0026gt;/redfish/v1/AccountSystem/Accounts | jq Example output:\n{ \u0026quot;@odata.context\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/$metadata#ManagerAccountCollection.ManagerAccountCollection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;@odata.id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;@odata.type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;#ManagerAccountCollection.ManagerAccountCollection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Accounts Collection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;BMC User Accounts\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Members@odata.count\u0026quot;: 4, \u0026quot;Members\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;@odata.id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/1\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;@odata.id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/2\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;@odata.id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/3\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;@odata.id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/4\u0026quot; } ] }   For each account listed, use curl to find the one which describes the root account (\u0026ldquo;UserName\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;).\nNOTES:\n The root account can be any of the listed accounts \u0026ndash; no guarantees as to which one it will be.

	"content": "Recreate StatefulSet Pods on Another Node Some pods are members of StatefulSets, meaning that there is a very specific number of them, each likely running on a different node. Similar to DaemonSets, these pods will never be recreated on another node as long as they are sitting in a Terminating state.\nWarning: This procedure should only be done for pods that are known to no longer be running. Corruption may occur if the worker node is still running when deleting the deleting the StatefulSet pod in a Terminating state.\nThe design of StatefulSet pods prohibits the creation of new pods on another node. This is the expected behavior for StatefulSet pods. In many cases, the StatefulSet is a set of only one pod. If a StatefulSet pod needs to be recreated on another node, the Terminating pod needs to be force deleted and then it will automatically recreate.\nThis procedure prevents services from being taken out of service when a node goes down.\nPrerequisites  A StatefulSet pod failed to be moved to another healthy non-compute node (NCN) acting as a worker node. If the network is being brought down temporarily during testing, ignore any issues with StatefulSet pods until the testing is complete. These errors should be ignored because the nodes could have the network restored, and then the Terminating pod may go ACTIVE temporarily (causing a race and corruption) if it comes up at the same time as another StatefulSet running the pod. This is much more likely to occur during testing of a network outage.

After cabinets are powered on, wait at least 10 minutes for systems to initialize.\nAfter all the system cabinets are powered on, be sure that all management network and Slingshot network switches are powered on and there are no error LEDS or hardware failures.\nPower on and Boot the Kubernetes Management Cluster To power on the management cabinet and bring up the management Kubernetes cluster, refer to Power On and Start the Management Kubernetes Cluster.\nPower on Compute and IO Cabinets To power on all liquid-cooled cabinet CDUs and cabinet PDUs, refer to Power On Compute and IO Cabinets.\nPower on the External Lustre File System To power an external Lustre file system (ClusterStor), refer to Power On the External Lustre File System.\nBring up the Slingshot Fabric To bring up the Slingshot fabric, see:\n The Slingshot Administration Guide for Cray EX systems PDF. The Slingshot Troubleshooting Guide PDF.  Power On and Boot Compute Nodes and User Access Nodes (UANs) To power on and boot compute nodes and UANs, refer to Power On and Boot Compute and User Access Nodes and make nodes available to customers.\nRun System Health Checks After power on, refer to Validate CSM Health to check system health and status.\n"

	"content": "User Access to Compute Node Power Data Shasta Liquid Cooled AMD EPYC compute node power management data available to users.\nShasta Liquid Cooled compute blade power management counters (pm_counters) enable users access to energy usage over time for billing and job profiling.\nThe blade-level and node-level accumulated energy telemetry is point-in-time power data. Blade accumulated energy data is collected out-of-band and is made available via workload managers. Users have access to the data in-band at the node-level via a special sysfs files in /sys/cray/pm\\_counters on the node.\nTime-stamped energy data from each node can be captured for a specific job before, during, and after the job to generate a power profile about the job. This energy usage data can be used in conjunction with current energy costs to assign a monetary value to the job.\nThe node CPU vendor provides specific in-band and out-of-band interfaces for controlling power management. In-band interfaces are accessed from the node OS through /sys/cray/pm\\_counters. Out-of-band interfaces are accessed from a node BMC or Redfish API.\nNote that each node has a power supply that can support a fixed number of Watts. The combined power consumption of the CPU and the accelerator can never exceed this limit, thus, power to either the CPU or the accelerator must be capped so as not to exceed the total amount of power available.\npm_counters Access to compute node power and energy data is provided by a set of files located in /sys/cray/pm\\_counters/ on the node. All pm_counters are accompanied by a timestamp.\n   File Description     power Point-in-time power (Watts). When accelerators are present, includes accel_power.

This ConfigMap has a random UUID name like e0543eb5-3445-4ee0-93ec-c53e3d1832ce. Prior to deleting a BOA job, delete its ConfigMap. Find the BOA job\u0026rsquo;s ConfigMap with the following command:\nncn# kubectl -n services describe job \u0026lt;BOA Job ID\u0026gt; |grep ConfigMap -A 1 -B 1 Example:\nncn# kubectl -n services describe job boa-0216d2d9-b2bc-41b0-960d-165d2af7a742 |grep ConfigMap -A 1 -B 1 boot-session: Type: ConfigMap (a volume populated by a ConfigMap) Name: e0543eb5-3445-4ee0-93ec-c53e3d1832ce \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; ConfigMap name. Delete this one. -- ca-pubkey: Type: ConfigMap (a volume populated by a ConfigMap) Name: cray-configmap-ca-public-key Delete the ConfigMap associated with the boot-session, not the ca-pubkey.\nTo delete the ConfigMap:\nncn# kubectl -n services delete cm \u0026lt;ConfigMap name\u0026gt; Example:\nncn# kubectl -n services delete cm e0543eb5-3445-4ee0-93ec-c53e3d1832ce configmap \u0026#34;e0543eb5-3445-4ee0-93ec-c53e3d1832ce\u0026#34; deleted   Delete the BOA job(s).\nncn# kubectl -n services delete job \u0026lt;BOA JOB ID\u0026gt; This will kill the BOA job and the BOS session associated with it.\nWhen a job is killed, BOA will no longer attempt to execute the operation it was attempting to perform. This does not mean that nothing continues to happen. If BOA has instructed a node to power on, the node will continue to power even after the BOA job has been killed.\n  Delete the BOS session. BOS keeps track of sessions in its database. These entries need to be deleted. The BOS Session ID is the same as the BOA Job ID minus the prepended \u0026lsquo;boa-\u0026rsquo; string. Use the following command to delete the BOS database entry.\nncn# cray bos session delete \u0026lt;session ID\u0026gt; Example:\nncn# cray bos session delete 0216d2d9-b2bc-41b0-960d-165d2af7a742     Coordinate with the site to prevent new sessions from starting in the services listed.\nThere is no method to prevent new sessions from being created as long as the service APIs are accessible on the API gateway.\n  Follow the vendor workload manager documentation to drain processes running on compute nodes. For Slurm, see the scontrol man page. For PBS Professional, see the pbsnodes man page.\n  Next Step Return to System Power Off Procedures and continue with next step.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Set the Turbo Boost Limit Turbo boost limiting is supported on the Intel® and AMD® processors. Because processors have a high degree of variability in the amount of turbo boost each processor can supply, limiting the amount of turbo boost can reduce performance variability and reduce power consumption.\nTurbo boost can be limited by setting the turbo_boost_limit kernel parameter to one of these values:\n 0 - Disable turbo boost 999 - (default) No limit is applied.  The following values are not supported in COS v1.4:\n 100 - Limits turbo boost to 100 MHz 200 - Limits turbo boost to 200 MHz 300 - Limits turbo boost to 300 MHz 400 - Limits turbo boost to 400 MHz  The limit applies only when a high number of cores are active. On an N-core processor, the limit is in effect when the active core count is N, N-1, N-2, or N-3.

	"content": "Shut Down and Power Off the Management Kubernetes Cluster Shut down management services and power off the HPE Cray EX management Kubernetes cluster.\nUnderstand the following concepts before powering off the management non-compute nodes (NCNs) for the Kubernetes cluster and storage:\n The etcd cluster provides storage for the state of the management Kubernetes cluster. The three node etcd cluster runs on the same nodes that are configured as Kubernetes Master nodes. The management cluster state must be frozen when powering off the Kubernetes cluster. When one member is unavailable, the two other members continue to provide full access to the data. When two members are down, the remaining member will switch to only providing read-only access to the data. Avoid Unnecessary Data Movement with Ceph - The Ceph cluster runs not only on the dedicated storage nodes, but also on the nodes configured as Kubernetes Master nodes. Specifically, the mon processes. If one of the storage nodes goes down, Ceph can rebalance the data onto the remaining nodes and object storage daemons (OSDs) to regain full protection. Avoid Spinning up Replacement Pods on Worker Nodes - Kubernetes keeps all pods running on the management cluster. The kubelet process on each node retrieves information from the etcd cluster about what pods must be running. If a node becomes unavailable for more than five minutes, Kubernetes creates replacement pods on other management nodes. High-Speed Network (HSN) - When the management cluster is shut down the HSN is also shut down.  The sat bootsys command automates the shutdown of Ceph and the Kubernetes management cluster and performs these tasks:\n Stops etcd and which freezes the state of the Kubernetes cluster on each management node. Stops and disables the kubelet on each management and worker node. Stops all containers on each management and worker node. Stop containerd on each management and worker node. Stops Ceph from rebalancing on the management node that is running a mon process.  Prerequisites An authentication token is required to access the API gateway and to use the sat command. See the \u0026ldquo;SAT Authentication\u0026rdquo; section of the HPE Cray EX System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product stream documentation (S-8031) for instructions on how to acquire a SAT authentication token.\nProcedure CHECK HEALTH OF THE MANAGEMENT CLUSTER\n  To check the health and status of the management cluster before shutdown, see the \u0026ldquo;Platform Health Checks\u0026rdquo; section in Validate CSM Health.\n  Check the health and backup etcd clusters:\na. Determine what etcd clusters must be backed up and if they are healthy. Review Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters.\nb. Backup etcd clusters. See Backups for etcd-operator Clusters.\n  Check the status of NCN no wipe settings. Make sure metal.no-wipe=1.

	"content": "Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) The Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service enables direct hardware control of nodes, compute blades, router modules, and liquid cooled chassis. CAPMC talks to BMCs via Redfish to control power, query status, and manage power capping on target components. These controls enable an administrator and 3rd party software to more intelligently manage state and system-wide power consumption.\nAdministrators can use the cray CLI for power operations from any system that has HTTPS access to the System Management Services.\nThird party software can access the API directly. Refer to the CAPMC API documentation for detailed information about API options and features.\nThe cray capmc command (see --help) can be used to control power to specific components by specifying the component NID, xname, or group.\nPower Control and Query by xname  xname_on xname_off xname_reinit get_xname_status  CAPMC power control assumes that all cabinets and PDUs have been plugged in, breakers are on, and PDU controllers, BMCs, and other embedded controller are on, available, and have been discovered. Components have their power controlled in a pre-defined order to properly handle requests of dependent components.\nImportant: It is recommended to use the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) to boot (power On), shutdown, and reboot compute nodes.\nControllable Components Air Cooled Cabinets\n Compute Nodes NCNs  Liquid Cooled Cabinets\n Chassis Slingshot Switch modules Compute blades Compute nodes  CAPMC uses xnames to specify entire cabinets or specific components throughout the system. By default, CAPMC controls power to only one component at a time. A --recursive true option can be passed to CAPMC using the cray CLI. When the --recursive true option is included in a request, all of the sub-components of the target component are included in the power command.\nBy the cabinet naming convention, each cabinet in the system is assigned a unique number. Cabinet numbers can range from 0-9999 and contain from 1-4 digits only.\nAlthough manufacturing typically follows a sequential cabinet numbering scheme:\n Liquid Cooled cabinet numbers: x1000–x2999 Air Cooled cabinet numbers: x3000–x4999 Liquid Cooled TDS cabinet numbers: x5000–5999  Examples of valid xnames:\n Full system: s0, all Cabinet numbers: x1000, x3000, x5000 Chassis numbers 0-7: x1000c7, x3500c0 (Air Cooled cabinets are always chassis 0) Compute Blade Slots 0-7: x1000c7s3, x3500c0s15 (U15) Compute Nodes: x1000c7s3b0n0, x3500c0s15b1n0 NCN Slots: x3200c0s9 (U9) NCN Nodes: x3200c0s9b0n0  Power Capping  get_power_cap_capabilities get_power_cap set_power_cap  CAPMC is capable of setting node power limits on all supported compute node hardware in both liquid cooled cabinets and air cooled cabinets. This functionality enables external software to establish an upper bound, or estimate a minimum bound, on the amount of power a system may consume. Separate CAPMC calls are required to power cap different compute node types as each compute node type has its own power capping capabilities.\nNOTE: Power capping is not supported for liquid cooled chassis, switch modules, compute blades, and any non-compute nodes (NCNs) in air cooled cabinets.\nDeprecated Interfaces See the CAPMC Deprecation Notice for more information\nPower Control and Query by NID Use the interfaces from Power control and query by xname:\n node_on node_off node_reinit get_node_status  Power Control and Query by group Use the interfaces from Power control and query by xname:\n group_on group_off group_reinit get_group_status  Node Energy Use the System Monitoring Application (SMA) Grafana instance:\n get_node_energy get_node_energy_stats get_node_energy_counters  System Monitor Use the System Monitoring Application (SMA) Grafana instance:\n get_system_parameters get_system_power get_system_power_details  Others  get_node_rules emergency_power_off get_nid_map  "

Facility power must be disconnected to completely remove power from the cabinet. Follow lockout-tagout procedures for the site before maintenance.\nStandard Racks - HPE Cray standard EIA racks typically include 2 redundant PDUs. Some PDU models may require a flat-blade screw driver to open or close the PDU circuit breakers.\nWarning: The cabinet PDUs remain energized when circuit breakers are OFF. Facility power must be disconnected or the PDUs must be unplugged to completely remove power from the rack. Follow lockout-tagout procedures for the site before maintenance.\nPrerequisites  An authentication token is required to access the API gateway and to use the sat command.

	"content": "Power On Compute and IO Cabinets Power on liquid-cooled and standard rack cabinet PDUs.\nLiquid-cooled Cabinets - HPE Cray EX liquid-cooled cabinet CDU and PDU circuit breakers are controlled manually.\nAfter the CDU is switched on and healthy, the liquid-cooled PDU circuit breakers can be switched ON. With PDU breakers ON, the Chassis Management Modules (CMM) and Cabinet Environmental Controllers (CEC) power on and boot. These devices can then communicate with the management cluster and larger system management network. HVDC power remains OFF on liquid-cooled chassis until environmental conditions are normal and the CMMs receive a chassis power-on command from Cray System Management (CSM) software.\nStandard Racks - HPE Cray standard EIA racks include redundant PDUs. Some PDU models may require a flat-blade screw driver to open or close the PDU circuit breakers.\nPrerequisites  The cabinet PDUs and coolant distribution units are connected to facility power and are healthy. An authentication token is required to access the API gateway and to use the sat command. See the \u0026ldquo;SAT Authentication\u0026rdquo; section of the HPE Cray EX System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product stream documentation (S-8031) for instructions on how to acquire a SAT authentication token.

The --stage cabinet-power option controls power only to liquid-cooled cabinets.\nIf sat bootsys fails to schedule hms-discovery with the following message, then delete and recreate the cron job.\nERROR: The cronjob hms-discovery in namespace services was not scheduled within expected window after being resumed. If sat bootsys fails to power on the cabinets through hms-discovery, use CAPMC to manually power on the cabinet chassis, compute blade slots, and all populated switch blade slots (1, 3, 5, and 7).

Compute and I/O nodes do not power on and boot automatically. The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) brings up compute nodes and User Access Nodes (UANs).\nIf necessary, use IPMI commands to power on individual servers as needed.\n  Make sure all system management network switches and Slingshot network switches are powered on in each rack and there are no error LEDS or hardware failures.\n  Bring up the Slingshot Fabric. Refer to the following documentation for more information on how to bring up the Slingshot Fabric:\n The Slingshot Administration Guide PDF for HPE Cray EX systems.

However, it most likely indicates that a Nexus setup utility was unable to connect to Nexus via the packages.local name. Because the install does not attempt to connect to packages.local until Nexus has been successfully deployed, the error does not usually indicate something is actually wrong with Nexus. Instead, it is most commonly a network issue with name resolution (i.e., DNS), IP routes from the PIT node, switch misconfiguration, or Istio ingress.\nVerify that packages.local resolves to ONLY the load balancer IP address for the istio-ingressgateway service in the istio-system namespace, typically 10.92.100.71. If name resolution returns addresses on other networks (such as HMN) this must be corrected. Prior to DNS/DHCP hand-off to Unbound, these settings are controlled by dnsmasq. Unbound settings are based on SLS settings in sls_input_file.json and must be updated via the Unbound manager.\nIf packages.local resolves to the correct addresses, verify basic connectivity using ping. If ping packages.local is unsuccessful, verify the IP routes from the PIT node to the NMN load balancer network. The typical ip route configuration is 10.92.100.0/24 via 10.252.0.1 dev bond0.nmn0. If pings are successful, try checking the status of Nexus by running curl -sS https://packages.local/service/rest/v1/status/writable. If the connection times out, it indicates there is a more complex connection issue. Lastly, check Istio and OPA logs to see if connections to packages.local are not reaching Nexus, perhaps because of an authorization issue.\nIf https://packages.local/service/rest/v1/status/writable returns an HTTP code other than 200 OK, it indicates there is an issue with Nexus. Verify that the loftsman ship deployment of the nexus.yaml manifest was successful. If helm status -n nexus cray-nexus indicates the status is NOT deployed, then something is most likely wrong with the Nexus deployment and additional diagnosis is required. In this case, the current Nexus deployment probably needs to be uninstalled and the nexus-data PVC removed before attempting to deploy again.\n"

In this case, this would ensure the mgmt NICs do not get labeled as HSN NICs:\n Note: The HSN NICs key off of the Device ID, not the Vendor ID.\n ```bash pit# # Restore the initrd.img.xz, kernel, and filesystem.squashfs links to the boot directories pit# set-sqfs-links.sh pit # Replace the default Vendor ID with the desired Intel Vendor ID pit# sed -i 's/hsn_did0 .*/hsn_did0 0000/g' /var/www/ncn-m*/script.ipxe pit# sed -i 's/hsn_did0 .*/hsn_did0 0000/g' /var/www/ncn-s*/script.ipxe ```    At this point the system is primed to boot custom PCIe or onboard NICs and the boot files removed in step 1 are now restored.\n  Save these scripts off the system for easy re-install at a later date:\npit# SYSTEM_NAME=eniac pit# tar -czvf $SYSTEM_NAME-boot-scripts.tar.gz /var/www/ncn-*/script.ipxe   "

	"content": "Manage Repositories with Nexus This section describes how to connect to Nexus with the Web UI, as well as how to access the REST API from non-compute nodes (NCNs) or compute nodes to manage repositories.\nAccess Nexus with the Web UI Use the hostname set in istio.ingress.hosts.ui.authority (see below) to connect to Nexus over the Customer Access Network (CAN) using a web browser. For example:\nhttps://nexus.{{network.dns.external}}/ Use Keycloak to Create and Manage Accounts In order to log into the Web UI or authenticate with the REST API, a user account with appropriate permissions must be created. Accounts are managed in Keycloak (see Configure Keycloak Accounts). To add administrator permissions for Nexus, add the nx-admin role binding to the user from the system-nexus-client client (see below). To add an anonymous user, add the nx-anonymous role binding to the user from the system-nexus-client client (see below).\nUse the Local Nexus Admin Account During the deployment or update of Nexus, a local admin account is created. To access the local admin account for Nexus on any NCN, run the following commands:\nncn# kubectl -n nexus get secret nexus-admin-credential --template {{.data.username}} | base64 -d; echo ncn# kubectl -n nexus get secret nexus-admin-credential --template {{.data.password}} | base64 -d; echo The first command will print the username of the local admin account. The second command will print the password for the local admin account. (Note that the secret will not update or stay in sync if the username or password of the local account is changed.). This account has the same permissions as an account created in Keycloak with the nx-admin role.\nAccess Nexus with the REST API The Nexus REST API is available from NCNs or compute nodes at https://packages.local/service/rest, as well as over the Customer Access Network (CAN) at https://nexus.\\{\\{network.dns.external\\}\\}/service/rest (requires authentication with username and password).\nDownload the Open API document at /service/rest/swagger.json for details about the API, including specific options to available endpoints. By default, the REST API endpoints return (or accept) JSON.\nThe examples in the following sections use curl to exercise the REST API endpoints and jq to parse and manipulate the output. It is reasonable to use curl and jq to facilitate management tasks when necessary, but more complex actions may warrant development of more full-featured tools.\nThe following actions are described in this section:\n Check the Status of Nexus List Repositories List Assets Create a Repository Update a Repository Delete a Repository Create a Blob Store Delete a Blob Store  Pagination Various API endpoints use the external pagination too to return results. When a continuationToken is included in the results and is non-null, it indicates additional items are available.\nThe following is some example output:\n{ \u0026#34;items\u0026#34;: [...], \u0026#34;continuationToken\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0a1b9d05d7162aa85d7747eaa75f171c\u0026#34; } In this example, the next set of results may be obtained by re-requesting the same URL with the added query parameter continuationToken=0a1b9d05d7162aa85d7747eaa75f171c.\nVarious examples in the following sections may use the paginate helper function to iterate over paginated results:\nfunction paginate() { local url=\u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; local token { token=\u0026#34;$(curl -sSk \u0026#34;$url\u0026#34; | tee /dev/fd/3 | jq -r \u0026#39;.continuationToken // null\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;; } 3\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 until [[ \u0026#34;$token\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;null\u0026#34; ]]; do { token=\u0026#34;$(curl -sSk \u0026#34;$url\u0026amp;continuationToken=${token}\u0026#34; | tee /dev/fd/3 | jq -r \u0026#39;.continuationToken // null\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;; } 3\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 done } Check the Status of Nexus Send an HTTP GET request to /service/rest/v1/status to check the operating status of Nexus. An HTTP 200 OK response indicates it is healthy:\n# curl -sSi https://packages.local/service/rest/v1/status HTTP/2 200 date: Sat, 06 Mar 202117:27:56 GMT server: istio-envoy x-content-type-options: nosniff content-length: 0 x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 6 Before attempting to write to Nexus, it is recommended to check that Nexus is writable by sending an HTTP GET request to /service/rest/v1/status/writable:\n# curl -sSi https://packages.local/service/rest/v1/status/writable HTTP/2 200 date: Sat, 06 Mar 202117:28:34 GMT server: istio-envoy x-content-type-options: nosniff content-length: 0 x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 6 List Repositories Use the /service/rest/v1/repositories endpoint to get a basic listing of available repositories:\n# curl -sSk https://packages.local/service/rest/v1/repositories | jq -r \u0026#39;.[] | .name\u0026#39; The /service/rest/beta/repositories endpoint provides a more detailed listing of available repositories.

For example, the Cray System Management (CSM) product uses csm.\nThe default blob store is also available, but Cray products are discouraged from using it.\nRepositories CSM creates the registry (format docker) and charts (format helm) repositories for managing container images and Helm charts across all Cray products. However, each product\u0026rsquo;s release may contain a number of RPM repositories that are added to Nexus. RPM repositories are created in Nexus as raw repositories to support signed repository metadata and to enable client GPG checks.\nRepository Naming Conventions RPM repositories should be named in the \u0026lt;product\u0026gt;[-\u0026lt;product-version\u0026gt;]-\u0026lt;os-dist\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;os-version\u0026gt;[-compute][-\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;] format. The following is a description of each component in an RPM repository name:\n \u0026lt;product\u0026gt; indicates the product. For example, cos, csm, and sma. -\u0026lt;product-version\u0026gt; indicates the product version. For example, -1.4.0, -latest, -stable.  Type hosted repositories must specify -\u0026lt;product-version\u0026gt; relative to the patch release. Type group or proxy repositories whose sole member is a hosted repository (for instance, it serves as an alias) may use a more generic version, such as -1.4, or omit -\u0026lt;product-version\u0026gt; altogether if it represents the currently active version.   -\u0026lt;os-dist\u0026gt; indicates the OS distribution, such as -sle. -\u0026lt;os-version\u0026gt; indicates the OS version, such as -15sp1 or -15sp2. -compute must be specified if the repository contains RPMs specific to compute nodes and omitted otherwise. There is no suffix for repositories containing NCN RPMs. -\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt; must be specified if the repository contains RPMs specific to a system architecture other than x86_64, such as -aarch64.

	"content": "Nexus Deployment Nexus is deployed with the cray-nexus chart to the nexus namespace as part of the Cray System Management (CSM) release. Nexus is deployed after critical platform services are up and running. Product installers configure and populate Nexus blob stores and repositories using the cray-nexus-setup container image. As a result, there is no singular product that provides all Nexus repositories or assets; instead, individual products must be installed. However, CSM configures the charts Helm repository and the registry Docker repository, which all products may use.\nCustomizations For a complete set of available settings, consult the values.yaml file for the cray-nexus chart. The most common customizations to set are specified in the following table. They must be set in the customizations.yaml file under the spec.kubernetes.services.cray-nexus setting.\n   Customization Default Description     istio.ingress.hosts.ui.enabled true Enables ingress from the CAN (default chart value is false)   istio.ingress.hosts.ui.authority nexus.{{ network.dns.external }} Sets the CAN hostname (default chart value is nexus.local)   sonatype-nexus.persistence.storageSize 1000Gi Nexus storage size, may be increased after installation; critical if spec.kubernetes.services.cray-nexus-setup.s3.enabled is false    If modifying the customizations.yaml file, ensure to upload the new file to Kubernetes so the changes persist in future installs or upgrades.\nncn-m001# kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init ncn-m001# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml Common Nexus Deployments A typical deployment will look similar to the following:\n# kubectl -n nexus get all Example output:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/cray-precache-images-6tp2c 2/2 Running 0 20d pod/cray-precache-images-dnwdx 2/2 Running 0 20d pod/cray-precache-images-jgvx8 2/2 Running 0 20d pod/cray-precache-images-n2clw 2/2 Running 0 20d pod/cray-precache-images-v8ntg 2/2 Running 0 17d pod/cray-precache-images-xmg6d 2/2 Running 0 20d pod/nexus-55d8c77547-xcc2f 2/2 Running 0 19d NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/nexus ClusterIP 10.23.120.95 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 80/TCP,5003/TCP 19d NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE NODE SELECTOR AGE daemonset.apps/cray-precache-images 6 6 6 6 6 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 20d NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE deployment.apps/nexus 1/1 1 1 19d NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE replicaset.apps/nexus-55d8c77547 1 1 1 19dd The cray-precache-images DaemonSet is used to keep select container images resident in the image cache on each worker node to ensure Nexus resiliency. It is deployed as a critical platform component prior to Nexus.\nWARNING: The cray-nexus chart deploys Nexus with a single replica and the corresponding nexus-data PVC with RWX access mode. Nexus should NEVER be scaled to more than one replica; otherwise, the instance data in nexus-data PV will most likely be corrupted. Using RWX access mode enables Nexus to quickly restart on another worker node in the event of a node failure and avoid additional delay because of volume multi-attach errors.\nBootstrap Registry During installation, a Nexus instance is run on the PIT node at port 8081 to facilitate cluster bootstrap. It is only configured with a docker registry available at http://pit.nmn:5000, which is populated with container images included in the CSM release.\nBy default, http://pit.nmn:5000 is the default mirror configured in /etc/containerd/config.toml. However, once the PIT node is rebooted as ncn-m001, it will no longer be available.\nProduct installers Product installers vendor the dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-nexus-setup:0.4.0 container image, which includes helper scripts for working with the Nexus REST API to update and modify repositories. Product release distributions will include the nexus-blobstores.yaml and nexus-repositories.yaml files, which define the Nexus blob stores and repositories required for that version of the product. Also, expect to find directories that include specific types of assets:\n rpm/ - RPM repositories docker/ - Container images helm/ - Helm Charts  Prior to deploying Helm charts to the system management Kubernetes cluster, product installers will setup repositories in Nexus and then upload assets to them. Typically, all of this is automated in the beginning of a product\u0026rsquo;s install.sh script, and will look something like the following:\nROOTDIR=\u0026#34;$(dirname \u0026#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\u0026#34;)\u0026#34;source\u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/lib/version.sh\u0026#34;source\u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/lib/install.sh\u0026#34;# Load vendored tools into install environment load-install-deps # Upload the contents of an RPM repository named $repo nexus-upload raw \u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/rpm/${repo}\u0026#34;\u0026#34;${RELEASE_NAME}-${RELEASE_VERSION}-${repo}\u0026#34;# Setup Nexus nexus-setup blobstores \u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/nexus-blobstores.yaml\u0026#34; nexus-setup repositories \u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/nexus-repositories.yaml\u0026#34;# Upload container images to registry.local skopeo-sync \u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/docker\u0026#34;# Upload charts to the \u0026#34;charts\u0026#34; repository nexus-upload helm \u0026#34;${ROOTDIR}/helm\u0026#34; charts # Remove vendored tools from install environment clean-install-deps Product installers also load and clean up the install tools used to facilitate installation.

By default, access to the container registry is not available over the Customer Access Network (CAN). If desired, a corresponding route may be added to the nexus VirtualService resource in the nexus namespace:\nWARNING: If access to the container registry in Nexus is exposed over CAN, it is strongly recommended to setup and configure fine-grained access control.

By default, product installers use Podman with a vendor version of the Skopeo image to sync container images included in a release distribution to registry.local.\nThe Cray System Management (CSM) product adds a recent version of quay.io/skopeo/stable to the container registry, and it may be used to copy images into registry.local.

	"content": "TLS Certificates for Redfish BMCs Redfish HTTP communications are capable of using TLS certificates and Certificate Authority (CA) trust bundles to improve security. Several Hardware Management Services (HMS) have been modified to enable the HTTP transports used for Redfish communications to use a CA trust bundle.\nThe following services communicate with Redfish BMCs:\n State Manager Daemon (SMD) Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) Firmware Action Service (FAS) HMS Collector River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS)  Each Redfish BMC must have a TLS certificate in order to be useful. The certificates will come from the same PKI that issues the CA trust bundle. The Vault PKI is used to create the TLS certs. Services will get the CA trust bundle either directly from the Vault PKI, or it can be read in via a Kubernetes ConfigMap.\nTLS Certificate Creation TLS certificates are created by the System Configuration Service (SCSD) tool and are stored in Vault secure storage for later retrieval. Each certificate can be created at any level or domain from the individual BMC, all the way up to a cabinet-level. Any certificate created above the BMC domain will contain enough Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to cover that domain. The goal and intent is to create certificates at the cabinet domain, containing the SANs for every possible BMC in that cabinet.\nRefer to Add TLS Certificates to BMCs for the SCSD commands used to create and store the certificates.\nOnce the certificates are created, they can be placed on the target BMCs again using SCSD. Only liquid-cooled BMCs can have TLS certificates set in them.\nCA Bundle Usage By Services Services will use a CA trust bundle when creating secured/validated HTTP clients and transports for use in Redfish operations. Any services that communicate with other services must not use this same client/transport because these services are within the service mesh and do not use TLS certificates. Thus, most services will need different HTTP clients/transports for Redfish and for inter-service communications.\nThe CA trust bundle is placed into a file visible by each HMS service. The Helm chart for each service will specify where this file is located. In addition, there is an environment variable (CA_URI) that comes from a value in customizations.yaml and will direct the service to point to either the Vault PKI\u0026rsquo;s CA bundle or to the ConfigMap bundle.\nIf the CA_URI variable is an empty string, it means that the customizations.yaml has no special entry for it. In this event, each service is set up to not use a CA bundle for Redfish HTTP clients/transports. Thus, this implementation is very backward compatible.\n"

Add an IP address that is not found or commonly assigned on the respective network.\n  Edit the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-FILENAME file.\nncn-w001# vi /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-FILENAME   Reload the interface.\nUse the following command to safely reload the interface:\nncn-w001# wicked ifreload INTERFACE_NAME If that does not work, attempt to forcefully add it:\nncn-w001# systemctl restart wickedd-nanny     Add the duplicate IP address with the ip command.\n  Add the duplicate IP.\nThe command below will bypass Wicked and will not honor the system preference:\nncn-w001# ip a a IP_ADDRESS/MASK dev INTERFACE_NAME For example:\nncn-w001# ip a a 10.1.1.1/16 dev bond0   View the bond.\nncn-w001# ip a s bond0 Example output:\n8: bond0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 9238 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether b8:59:9f:c7:11:12 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 10.1.1.1/16 brd 10.1.255.255 scope global bond0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::ba59:9fff:fec7:1112/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever   Delete the IP address after the duplicate IP address is removed.\nncn-w001# ip a d IP_ADDRESS/MASK dev bond0 For example:\nncn-w001# ip a d 10.1.1.1/16 dev bond0     (Not Recommended) Allow the duplicate IP address to exist.\nThis is not recommended because it is unstable and can make the work harder to correct down the line. The easiest way to deal with the duplicate is by adding another IP address, and then logging into the duplicate and nullifying it. This block will disable the safeguard for duplicate IP addresses.\nncn-w001# sed -i \u0026#39;^CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP=.*/CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP=\u0026#34;no\u0026#34;/\u0026#39; \\ /etc/sysconfig/network/config ncn-w001# wicked ifup INTERFACE_NAME     Notes   Running wicked ifreload on a worker node can have the side-effect of causing Slurm and UAI pods to lose their macvlan attachments. In this case, restarts of those services (in the Kubernetes user namespace) can be performed by executing the following command:\nncn-w# kubectl delete po -n user $(kubectl get po -n user | grep -v NAME | awk \u0026#39;\\{ print $1 }\u0026#39;)   "

The first NCN is port 01, the other three NCNs are ports 02–04, and the compute nodes are 05–08.\nTo move to any node in the system, use the arrow keys and press Enter. The login screen for that node will appear.\n"

	"content": "S3FS Usage and Guidelines for Shasta Introduction S3FS is being deployed as tool to provide temporary relief of space usage as well as supporting SDU/NMD services as a near-posix file system to provide a landing point for dumps.\nWhen to Use  If the need is a landing point for large files that may fill up the root volume. Short term storage of large files or rpms.  When NOT to Use  For long term storage of code, test images, test rpms, or tar files.  This is ONLY meant to provide temporary relief. Exercising a vigilant practice of cleaning up unused files should be enforced.   As a landing point to uncompress tar files.  This will put unnecessary load on the storage cluster as uncompressing a tar file will require a lot of reads and writes back to the object storage endpoints. Running programs from the S3FS mount point.  Although this can be done but will eat into memory for long running programs and may not perform properly.      Additional Considerations  Ensure it is only temporary use on master nodes.  SDU utilizes S3FS on the master servers and ideally we would like to reserve the S3FS cache partition for SDU. The cache partition is shared if utilizing automatically mounted partitions. Make sure you are utilizing the correct S3 credentials and buckets.    How To Use   Gather creds from radosgw\nNOTES:\n Please replace \u0026lt;radosgw-user\u0026gt; below with the UID for the radosgw/s3 user id. Make sure to use a meaningful filename for storing the credentials and replace \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; below.

	"content": "Node Management Workflows The following workflows are intended to be high-level overviews of node management tasks. These workflows depict how services interact with each other during node management and help to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nThe workflows and procedures in this section include:\n Add Nodes Remove Nodes Replace Nodes Move Nodes  Add Nodes  Add a Standard Rack Node  Use Cases: Administrator permanently adds select compute nodes to expand the system.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the System Layout Service (SLS) with other hardware management services (HMS).\nMentioned in this workflow:\n System Layout Service (SLS) serves as a \u0026ldquo;single source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the system design. It details the physical locations of network hardware, compute nodes and cabinets. Further, it stores information about the network, such as which port on which switch should be connected to each compute node. Hardware State Manager (HSM) monitors and interrogates hardware components in an HPE Cray EX system, tracking hardware state and inventory information, and making it available via REST queries and message bus events when changes occur. HMS Notification Fanout Daemon (hmnfd) receives component state change notifications from the HSM. It fans notifications out to subscribers (typically compute nodes). Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS/MEDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of Redfish-enabled BMCs. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if hardware is present or missing. Heartbeat Tracker Service (hbtd) listens for heartbeats from components (mainly compute nodes). It tracks changes in heartbeats and conveys changes to HSM.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occur during this workflow.\n  Administrator updates SLS\nAdministrator creates a new hardware entry for the select component names (xnames) in SLS. Enter the node component names (xnames) in the SLS input file.\n  Administrator adds compute nodes\nThe Administrator physically adds select compute nodes and powers them on. Because the nodes are unknown, the DHCP and TFTP servers give it the special initialization ramdisk. The compute nodes performs local configuration.\nThe following steps (3-11) occur automatically as different APIs interact with each other.\n  Set BMC credentials\nThe compute node requests per-node BMC credentials. This message must include the MAC address of the BMC. A new set of credentials is generated by the discovery service.\nOnce the compute node is powered on, initialized, and discovered, REDS gets details about the new node like IP address, MAC address, sets the username and password for a BMC, state etc.\n  REDS/MEDS to SLS\nREDS/MEDS query SLS database for information about the new node.\nFor example: \u0026ldquo;What component name (xname) is connected to port XX on switch Y?\u0026rdquo;\n  SLS to REDS/MEDS\nSLS updates the discovery service with the new compute node and its component name (xname).\nFor example: \u0026ldquo;xname x0c0\u0026hellip; is connected to port XX\u0026rdquo;.\n  REDS/MEDS to HSM\nDiscovery services update HSM about the new Redfish endpoint for the node. Details like component name (xname) and IP address of the new node are updated in HSM.\nFor example: \u0026ldquo;x0c0\u0026hellip; at IP address AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD\u0026rdquo;\n  HSM to SLS\nHSM queries SLS for NID and role assignments for the new node.\n  SLS to HSM\nHSM updates the Nodemap based on information received from SLS.\n  Node to Heartbeat Tracker Service\nThe Heartbeat Tracker Service receives heartbeats from the new compute node after the node is powered on.\n  Heartbeat Tracker Service to HSM\nThe Heartbeat Tracker Service report the heartbeat status to HSM.\n  HSM to HMNFD\nHSM sends the new compute node state information with State as ON to HMNFD. HMNFD fans out these notifications to the subscribing compute nodes.\n  Remove Nodes Use Cases: Administrator permanently removes select compute nodes to contract the system.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the System Layout Service (SLS) with other hardware management services (HMS).\nMentioned in this workflow:\n System Layout Service (SLS) serves as a \u0026ldquo;single source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the system design.

It tracks changes in heartbeats and conveys changes to HSM.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occur during this workflow.\n  Administrator updates SLS\nAdministrator deletes the node entries with the specific component name (xname) from SLS. Note that if deleting a parent object, then the children are also deleted from SLS. If the child object happens to be a parent, then the deletion can cascade down levels. If deleting a child object, it does not affect the parent.\n  Administrator physically removes the compute nodes\nThe Administrator powers off and physically removes the compute nodes.\nThe following steps (3-9) occur automatically as different APIs interact with each other.\n  No heartbeats\nThe Heartbeat Tracker Service stops receiving heartbeats and marks the nodes status as standby and then off as per Redfish event.\nStandby status implies that the node is no longer ready and presumed dead. It typically means that the heartbeat is lost. Off status implies that the location is not populated with a component.\n  Heartbeat Tracker Service to HSM\nThe Heartbeat Tracker Service reports the heartbeat status to HSM.\n  REDS/MEDS detect no BMC\nThe discovery service detects that the BMC is not there.\n  REDS/MEDS to SLS\nREDS/MEDS query SLS database for information about the missing BMCs.\n  SLS to REDS/MEDS\nSLS updates the discovery service that the BMC was removed.\n  REDS/MEDS to HSM\nDiscovery services update HSM that the BMC Redfish endpoints for the nodes were removed. HSM marks the state of BMCs and the nodes as empty.\nEmpty state implies that the location is not populated with a component.\n  HSM to HMNFD\nHSM sends the compute node state information with State as empty to HMNFD. HMNFD fans out this notification to the subscribing compute nodes.\n  Replace Nodes  Replace a Compute Blade Swap a Compute Blade with a Different System  Move Nodes  Move a Standard Rack Node Move a Standard Rack Node (Same HSN Ports)  "

	"content": "Build NCN Images Locally Build and test NCN images locally by using the following procedure. This procedure can be done on any x86 machine with the following prerequisites.\nNecessary Software The listed software below will equip a local machine or build server to build for any medium (.squashfs, .vbox, .qcow2, .iso).\n media (.iso, .ovf, or .qcow2) (depending on the layer) packer qemu envsubst  Media Packer can intake any ISO, the sections below detail utilized base ISOs in CRAY HPCaaS.\nFor any ISO, copy it into the iso directory.\nSuSE Linux Enterprise The file name is either:\n SLE-15-SP2-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso  Repositories You will need access to the appropriate SLES repositories in the form of official access, self-hosted access, or the provided Nexus access.\nTo build locally you will need to provide your own repositories file and the custom_repos_file variable must be passed with the packer command. The custom_repos_file variable is a filename that is placed into the custom folder of the project. The file must be formatted with the following fields: url name flags\n -var 'custom_repos_file=custom.repos'  And example entry for a custom repo:\nhttps://myserver.net/sles-mirror/Products/SLE-Module-Basesystem/15-SP3/x86_64/product SUSE-SLE-Module-Basesystem-15-SP3-x86_64-Pool -g -p 99 suse/SLE-Module-Basesystem/15-SP3/x86_64/product\nBuild Steps  There are two Providers that can be built; VirtualBox and QEMU VirtualBox is best for local development. QEMU is best for pipeline and portability on linux machines. Both outputs are capable of creating the kernel, initrd, and squashfs required to boot nodes.  Setup  Install packer from a reputable endpoint, like this one.  If you are building QEMU images in MacOS, you will need to adjust specific QEMU options:\n MacOS requires HVF for acceleration MacOS uses Cocoa for output -var 'qemu_display=cocoa' -var 'qemu_accelerator=hvf'  Notes  Setup environment variables by copying scripts/environment.template to scripts/environment and modifying the values for your environment. Ensure that SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso is in the iso/ folder Check out csm-rpms repository and create a symlink to it in the root directory of the project. Execute source scripts/environment Execute ./scripts/setup.sh Render the autoinst template  Quick Start git clone \u0026lt;csm-rpms-repo\u0026gt; git clone https://github.com/Cray-HPE/node-image-build.git cd node-image-build ln -s ../csm-rpms/ csm-rpms cp scripts/environment.template scripts/environment vim scripts/environment source scripts/environment mkdir -p iso wget https://\u0026lt;somepath\u0026gt;/SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso -O iso/SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso ./scripts/setup.sh Base Layer The base layer will install SLES 15 and prepare the image for the installation of Kubernetes and Ceph.\nExecute the following commands from the top level of the project\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.sles15-base -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/sles15-base/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-iso.sles15-base -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/sles15-base/  If you want to view the output of the build, disable headless mode:\n Run packer build -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'headless=false' boxes/sles15-base/  Once the images are built, the output will be placed in the output-sles15-base directory in the root of the project.\nCommon Layer The common layer starts from the output of the base layer. As such the base layer must be created before building common.\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-common/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-common/  Once the image is built, the output will be placed in the output-ncn-common directory in the root of the project.\nNon-Compute Node Image Layer The ncn-node-images stage builds on top of the common layer to create functional images for Kubernetes and Ceph.\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-node-images/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-node-images/  Once the images are built, the output will be placed in the output-sles15-images directory in the root of the project.\nArtifacts Each layer creates a certain set of artifacts that can be used in different ways.\n Each layer creates a VM disk image that can be directly booted and/or used to create the next layer\u0026rsquo;s image. Each layer after sles15-base creates a list of packages and repos. ncn-common creates kernel and initrd artifacts. ncn-node-images creates kernel, initrd, and squashfs artifacts.  Versioning  The version of the build is passed with the packer build command as the artifact_version var:  packer build -only=qemu.sles15-base -var \u0026#34;artifact_version=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`\u0026#34; -var \u0026#39;ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD\u0026#39; -var \u0026#39;headless=false\u0026#39; boxes/sles15-base/  If no version is passed to the builder then the version none is used when generating the archive.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Change Settings for HMS Collector Polling of Air Cooled Nodes The cray-hms-hmcollector service polls all Air Cooled hardware to gather the necessary telemetry information for use by other services, such as the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service. This polling occurs every 10 seconds on a continual basis. Instabilities with the AMI Redfish implementation in the Gigabyte BMCs requires a less significant approach when gathering power and temperature telemetry data. If the BMCs are overloaded, they can become unresponsive, return incorrect data, or encounter other errors.\nAll of these issues prevent other services, such as CAPMC and the Firmware Action Service (FAS), from successfully acting on the BMCs. Recovery from this state requires a BMC reset and sometimes a hard power cycle by unplugging the server and plugging it back in.\nCollecting telemetry data while trying to boot Air Cooled compute nodes increases the burden on the BMCs and increases the likelihood of BMC issues. The most likely time to encounter BMCs in a bad state is when trying to boot Air Cooled compute nodes and User Access Nodes (UANs) using the Boot Orchestration Service, or when trying to do a firmware and/or BIOS update on the nodes. Check the service logs of CAPMC and FAS for error information returned from the BMCs.\nRecommendations for Polling The following are the best practices for using the HMS Collector polling:\n  Do not query the power state of Air Cooled nodes using CAPMC more than two or three times a minute.\n  This is done via the CAPMC get_xname_status command.\nncn# cray capmc get_xname_status create --xnames LIST_OF_NODES     Polling of Air Cooled nodes should be disabled by default. Before nodes are booted, verify that cray-hms-hmcollector polling is disabled.\n  To check if polling is disabled:\nncn# kubectl get deployments.apps -n services cray-hms-hmcollector -o json | jq \\ \u0026#39;.spec.template.spec.containers[].env[]|select(.name==\u0026#34;POLLING_ENABLED\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;   To disable polling if it is not already:\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_ENABLED environment variable to false in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n    Only enable telemetry polling when needed, such as when running jobs.\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_ENABLED environment variable to true in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n  If BMCs are encountering issues at a high rate, increase the polling interval. Do not set the polling interval to less than the default of 10s.\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_INTERVAL environment variable to the selected rate in seconds. This value is located in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n  Reset BMCs in a Bad State Even with the polling recommendations above, it is still possible for the BMCs to end up in a bad state and will require a reset.\nTo restart the BMCs:\nncn# export USERNAME=root ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme ncn# ipmitool -H BMC_HOSTNAME -U $USERNAME -E -I lanplus mc reset cold If the reset does not recover the BMCs, then use the following steps to shut down the nodes, unplug the servers, and plug them back in:\n  Shut down the nodes.\nFor each server with a BMC in a bad state:\nncn# ipmitool -H BMC_HOSTNAME -U $USERNAME -E -I lanplus chassis power soft Wait 30 seconds after shutting down the nodes before proceeding.\n  Unplug the server Power Supply Units (PSUs) and wait 30 seconds.\n  Plug both server PSUs back in.\nWait a couple of minutes before proceeding.\n  Verify the BMCs are available again.\nncn# ping -c 1 BMC_HOSTNAME   Check the power of the nodes.\nncn# cray capmc get_xname_status create --xnames LIST_OF_NODES   After these steps, the nodes should be ready to be booted again with the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS).\n"

	"content": "Configuration of NCN Bonding Non-compute nodes (NCNs) have network interface controllers (NICs) connected to the management network that are configured in a redundant manner via Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) link aggregation. The link aggregation configuration can be modified by editing and applying various configuration files either through Ansible or the interfaces directly.\nThe bond configuration exists across three files on an NCN. These files may vary depending on the NCN in use:\n  ifcfg-bond0\nPhysical configuration and member interfaces.\n  ifroute-bond0\nRouting, which is critical for NCN PXE to work.\n  ifrule-bond0\nRouting table selecting, which is critical for NCN PXE to work.\n  The following is an example of ifcfg-bond0:\nncn-w001# cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-bond0 Example output:\nBONDING_MASTER='yes' BONDING_MODULE_OPTS='mode=802.3ad miimon=100 lacp_rate=fast xmit_hash_policy=layer2+3' BONDING_SLAVE0='p1p1' BONDING_SLAVE1='p1p2' MTU='9238' STARTMODE='auto' BOOTPROTO='static' PREFIXLEN='16' IPADDR='10.1.1.1/16' ZONE='Do not assign ZONE' The bond is configured with modules that can be changed at the network administrators discretion and coordination.\nIt may be useful to only adjust the XMIT value to layer2; the current setting is chosen as a default to match existing settings for compute nodes from the previous release. This can be weighed out if problems arise across the NCNs over the bond and dual-spine or Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG).\nWicked NetworkManager Wicked is the SUSE NetworkManager and Daemon wrapper for handling interfaces' processes and applying their configuration. See the SUSE Wicked external documentation for more information.\nFor administrators familiar with the more common Linux distribution, Ubuntu, it has an analogue to Wicked called NetPlan. The benefit is that it removes tedious, low-level configurations. However, Wicked and NetPlan each have their own web of configuration.

The CA trust bundle can also be modified at any time. When this is to be done, the following steps are needed:\n  Modify the CA trust bundle.\nOnce the CA trust bundle is modified, each service will automatically pick up the new CA bundle data. There is no manual step.\n  Regenerate the TLS cabinet-level certificates as done is the preceding step.\n  Place the TLS certificates onto the Redfish BMCs as in the preceding step.\n  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "MetalLB in BGP-Mode MetalLB is a component in Kubernetes that manages access to LoadBalancer services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. There are LoadBalancer services on the Node Management Network (NMN), Hardware Management Network (HMN), and Customer Access Network (CAN).\nMetalLB can run in either Layer2-mode or BGP-mode for each address pool it manages. BGP-mode is used for the NMN, HMN, and CAN. This enables true load balancing (Layer2-mode does failover, not load balancing) and allows for a more robust layer 3 configuration for these networks.\nIn BGP-mode, the MetalLB speakers will peer with the BGP router on the spine switches and advertise the service LoadBalancer IP addresses. The BGP routers will accept those advertised prefixes and add them to the route table. The spines are configured with Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP), meaning that each of these BGP route prefixes will load balance to any of the workers that has advertised the prefix. This process allows clients outside the cluster with access to the NMN, HMN, or CAN to be able to route to these Kubernetes services.\nBGP peering is only between the MetalLB speakers and the spine switches. It does not do any peering beyond that.\nThe routes in the BGP route table will only be the IP addresses of the Kubernetes LoadBalancer services. This is the fifth column displayed in the output of the following command:\nncn-w001# kubectl get service -A | grep LoadBalancer For example:\nNAMESPACE NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP **EXTERNAL-IP** PORT(S) AGE ceph-rgw cray-s3 LoadBalancer 10.31.54.80 10.102.10.129 8080:31003/TCP 36d ims cray-ims-40f523ac-9b99-4f76-bb37-df6eb62540c8-service LoadBalancer 10.21.156.88 10.102.10.134 22:31604/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-50287398-b877-4a2b-bf18-c3618583c66f-service LoadBalancer 10.29.254.221 10.102.10.167 22:30314/TCP 12d ims cray-ims-577dec6e-dbac-4363-a423-bf39ed9b9e32-service LoadBalancer 10.22.200.115 10.102.10.158 22:32672/TCP 15d ims cray-ims-5b05e86e-f65b-4a5f-b5eb-2c31f0458722-service LoadBalancer 10.25.162.244 10.102.10.160 22:32707/TCP 14d ims cray-ims-7ffaf10f-75ca-4ccb-b10d-1c7cd31b3d4b-service LoadBalancer 10.20.16.190 10.102.10.132 22:31934/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-b1cd0827-bb51-4bcd-ac25-f64d5f7d0c44-service LoadBalancer 10.26.69.180 10.102.10.131 22:31281/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-bd0698b4-a104-48eb-9714-5b5889ad7b52-service LoadBalancer 10.18.114.136 10.102.10.135 22:31701/TCP 35d MetalLB does not manage access to any of the NCNs, UANs, or compute nodes.\n"

	"content": "MetalLB in BGP-Mode Configuration MetalLB in BGP-mode provides a more robust configuration for the Node Management Network (NMN), Hardware Management Network (HMN), and Customer Access Network (CAN). This configuration is generated from the csi config init input values. BGP-mode is enabled by updating the protocols in these configuration files.\nMetalLB Peer Configuration The content for metallb_bgp_peers is generated by the csi config init command. In addition to the MetalLB configuration, there is configuration needed on the spine switches to set up the BGP router on these switches.\nThe MetalLB ConfigMap can also be viewed:\npeers: - peer-address: 10.252.0.1 peer-asn: 65533 my-asn: 65533 - peer-address: 10.252.0.3 peer-asn: 65533 my-asn: 65533 To retrieve data about BGP peers:\nncn-m001# kubectl get cm config -n metallb-system The speakers get their peering configuration from the MetalLB ConfigMap. This configuration specifies the IP address of the spine or aggregate switch, as well as the Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the speaker and the switch with which it is peering. This ASN should be the same for both.\nCAN Configuration This network has two MetalLB address pools, one for static IP allocation and the other for dynamic IP allocation. Static allocation guarantees the same IP allocation for services using this pool across deployment and installations. Dynamic allocations means that the allocated IP addresses will be in this pool, but may change depending on the timing and ordering of the IP allocation.\nView the address pool configurations in the MetalLB ConfigMap after localization occurs. The MetalLB ConfigMap should not be edited directly. The following is an example of the values in the ConfigMap:\n- name: can-dynamic-pool **protocol: bgp** addresses: **- 10.102.5.128/25** - name: can-static-pool **protocol: bgp** addresses: **- 10.102.5.112/28** The CAN configuration is set in the csi config init input:\nlinux# csi config init . . . --can-cidr 10.102.5.0/26 --can-gateway 10.102.5.27 --can-static-pool 10.102.5.28/30 --can-dynamic-pool 10.102.5.32/27 . . .

	"content": "Validate Switch Configs Prerequisites  SSH access to the switches or the running configuration file. Generated switch configurations.  Generate Switch Config   CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.  Run canu --version to see version. If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see this procedure: Update CANU From CSM Tarball    Compare CSM 1.2 switch configurations with running configurations Next compare the current running configuration with the generated configuration.\nFor the comparison, since we have pulled the configuration to our working directory we can compare the files locally. You can also have CANU pull the configuration from the switch by defining using the --ip, --username, and --password arguments.\nExample of CANU pulling configuration.\nncn# canu validate switch config --ip 192.168.1.1 --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --generated ./generated/sw-spine-001.cfg Doing file comparisons on your local machine:\n Comparing configuration file for single switch:  ncn# canu validate switch config --running ./running/sw-spine-001.cfg --generated sw-spine-001.cfg Please enter the vendor (Aruba, Dell, Mellanox): Aruba\n Comparing configuration files for full system:  ncn# canu validate network config --csm 1.2 --running ./running/ --generated ./generated/ CANU-generated switch configurations will not include any ports or devices not defined in the model. These were previously discussed in the Validate the SHCD section but include edge uplinks (CAN/CMN) and custom configurations applied by the customer.. When looking at the generated configurations being applied against existing running configurations CANU will recommend removal of some critical configurations. It is vital that these devices and configurations be identified and protected. This can be accomplished in three ways:\n  Provide CANU validation of generated configurations against running configurations with an override or \u0026ldquo;blackout\u0026rdquo; configuration – a yaml file which tells CANU to ignore customer-specific configurations. The process of creating this file was previously described in the This file will be custom to every site and must be distributed with the analysis and configuration file bundle to be used in the future.\n  Based on experienced networking knowledge, manually reorder the proposed upgrade configurations. This may require manual exclusion of required configurations which the CANU analysis says to remove.\n  Some devices may be used by multiple sites and may not currently be in the CANU architecture and configuration. If a device type is more universally used on several sites, then it should be added to the architectural and configuration definitions via the CANU code and Pull Request (PR) process.\n  Note: A roadmap item for CANU is the ability to \u0026ldquo;inject\u0026rdquo; customer configurations into CANU and provide solid, repeatable configuration customization.\nAnalyze CSM 1.2 configuration upgrade Configuration updates depending on the current version of network configuration may be as easy as adding few lines or be complete rip \u0026amp; replace operation which may lead you to choosing to wipe the existing configuration or just simply adding few lines in the configuration.\nAlways before making configuration changes, analyze the changes shown in the above configuration diff section.\n:exclamation: All of these steps should be done using an out of band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime :exclamation:\nCaveats and known issues  Mellanox and Dell support is limited. Some configuration may need to be applied in a certain order.  Example: Customer VRF needs to be applied before adding interfaces/routes to the VRF.   When applying certain configuration it may wipe out pre-existing configuration.  An example of this would be adding a VRF to a port.    For example:\nConfig differences between running config and generated config Safe Commands These commands should be safe to run while the system is running. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- interface 1/1/mgmt0 no shutdown interface 1/1/30 mtu 9198 description vsx isl interface vlan 7 ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.0 router ospf 1 vrf Customer router-id 10.2.0.2 default-information originate area 0.0.0.0 Manual Commands These commands may cause disruption to the system and should be done only during a maintenance period.

	"content": "Validate the SHCD Use the CSM Automated Network Utility (CANU) to validate the SHCD. SHCD validation is required to ensure Plan-of-Record network configurations are generated. This is an iterative process to create a model of the entire network topology connection-by-connection.\nTopics  Prerequisites before validating the SHCD Begin validation in the following order Checks and Validations Logging and Updates Output SHD to JSON  Prerequisites  Up to date SHCD. CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.  Run canu --version to see version. If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see this procedure: Update CANU From CSM Tarball    Prepare to Validate   Open existing SHCD in Excel.\n  Save a new copy with an incremented revision number and make sure the updated version is being edited.\n  Several worksheets (tabs) are used to store the topology of the management network.\nBegin Validation The SHCD must be validated in the following order:\n 10G_25G_40G_100G tab (or some variation thereof) contains switch-to-switch connections, as well as NCN server connections to the switch Node Management Network (NMN) contains network management nodes Hardware Management Network (HMN) contains device BMCs and other 1G management ports MTN_TDS, Mountain-TDS-Management, or some variation thereof for Mountain cabinets PDU  Validation Steps   Validate the 10G_25G_40G_100G tab and select the upper left corner and lower right corner of the spreadsheet with the Source Rack Location Slot Port Destination Rack Location Port information.\nThis is a block of data on the right hand of the worksheet and is not the calculated values used for cable labels on the left-hand side.\nIn this example above, the 10G_25G_40G_100G worksheet has the upper left and lower right corners of I37 and T107 respectively. Note, the above screenshot is trimmed and only the first full 68 rows are shown.\n  Use CANU to validate this worksheet.\nncn# canu validate shcd -a full --shcd ./HPE\\ System\\ Hela\\ CCD.revA27.xlsx --tabs 10G_25G_40G_100G --corners I37,T107 The -a or –architecture parameter can be set to tds, full, or v1 (case insensitive):\n tds – Aruba-based Test and Development System. These are small systems characterized by Kubernetes NCNs cabling directly to the spine. full – Aruba-based Leaf-Spine systems, usually customer production systems. v1 – Dell and Mellanox based systems of either a TDS or Full layout.  CANU will ensure that each cell has valid data and that the connections between devices are allowed. Errors will stop processing and must be fixed in the spreadsheet before moving on. A \u0026ldquo;clean run\u0026rdquo; through a worksheet will include the model, a port-map of each node and may include warnings. See a list of typical errors at the end of this document to help in fixing the worksheet data.\n  Check for errors after validating the worksheet.\nncn# canu validate shcd -a full --shcd ./HPE\\ System\\ Hela\\ CCD.revA27.xlsx --tabs 10G_25G_40G_100G,NMN --corners I37,T107,J15,T16 --log DEBUG   Checks and Validation A worksheet that runs \u0026ldquo;cleanly\u0026rdquo; will have checked that:\n  Nodes are \u0026ldquo;architecturally allowed\u0026rdquo; to connect to each other.\n  No overlapping ports specified.\n  A worksheet that runs cleanly will have checked that:\n  Nodes are architecturally allowed to connect to each other.\n  No overlapping ports specified.\n  Node connections can be made at the appropriate speeds.\n  In addition, a clean run will have the following sections:\n  SHCD Node Connections – A high level list of all node connections on the system.\n  SHCD Port Usage – A Port-by-port detailed listing of all node connections on the system.\n  Warnings:\n  A list of nodes found that are not categorized on the system.\nNote: This list is important as it could include misspellings of nodes that should be included!\n  A list of cell-by-cell warnings of misspellings and other nit-picking items that CANU has autocorrected on the system.\n    Check Warnings Critical: The Warnings output will contain a section headed \u0026ldquo;Node type could not be determined for the following\u0026rdquo;. This needs to be carefully reviewed because it may contain site uplinks that are not tracked by CANU but may also contain mis-spelled or mis-categorized nodes. As an example:\nFor example:\nNode type could not be determined for the following. These nodes are not currently included in the model. (This may be a missing architectural definition/lookup or a spelling error) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sheet: 10G_25G_40G_100G Cell: I96 Name: CAN switch Cell: I97 Name: CAN switch Cell: O87 Name: CAN switch Cell: O90 Name: CAN switch Cell: O93 Name: CAN switch Cell: O100 Name: CAN switch Cell: O103 Name: CAN switch Cell: I38 Name: sw-spinx-002 Sheet: HMN Cell: R36 Name: SITE Sheet: NMN Cell: P16 Name: SITE From the above example, two important observations can be made:\n  CAN and SITE uplinks are not in the clean run model. This means that these ports will not be configured.\n  Critically, Cell I38 has a name of \u0026ldquo;sw-spinx-002\u0026rdquo;. This should be noted as a misspelling of \u0026ldquo;sw-spine-002\u0026rdquo; and corrected.\n  Check SHCD Port Usage Today CANU validates many things, but a future feature is full cable specification checking of nodes (e.g. what NCN ports go to which switches to properly form bonds). There are several CANU roadmap items, but today a manual review of the \u0026ldquo;SHCD Port Usage\u0026rdquo; connections list is vital. Specifically, check:\n  K8S NCN cabling (manager, worker, storage) follows PoR cabling: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/install/cable_management_network_servers.md\n  UAN NCN cabling (UAN, viz, and other Application Nodes) follow PoR cabling: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/install/cable_management_network_servers.md\n  Switch pair cabling is appropriate for VSX, MAGP, etc.\n  Switch-to-switch cabling is appropriate for LAG formation.\n  Other nodes on the network seem sane.\n  Logging and Updates Once the SHCD has run cleanly through CANU and CANU output has been manually validated, changes to the SHCD should be committed so that work is not lost, and other users can take advantage of the CANU changes.\n  Add an entry to the changelog Config. Summary first worksheet.\nThe changelog should include:\n The CANU command line used to validate the spreadsheet The CANU version being used to validate the spreadsheet An overview of changes made to the spreadsheet    Upload the SHCD to an official storage location after it has been validated.\nEither of the following options can be used:\n customer communication (CAST ticket for customers) SharePoint (internal systems and sometimes customer systems)    Output SHCD to JSON  Once the SHCD is fully validated, the user will be able to output all the connection details to a json file. This output json file is used to generate switch configurations.  ncn# canu validate shcd -a v1 --shcd ./test.xlsx --tabs 40G_10G,NMN,HMN --corners I12,S37,I9,S20,I20,S31 --json --out cabling.json "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Why are spine-leaf architectures becoming more popular? Given the prevalence of cloud and containerized infrastructure in modern data centers, east-west traffic continues to increase. East-west traffic moves laterally, from server to server. This shift is primarily explained by modern applications having components that are distributed across more servers or VMs.\nWith east-west traffic, having low-latency, optimized traffic flows is imperative for performance, especially for time-sensitive or data-intensive applications. A spine-leaf architecture aids this by ensuring traffic is always the same number of hops from its next destination, so latency is lower and predictable.\nCapacity also improves because STP is no longer required or at least the impact zones of STP can be limited to the edge. While STP enables redundant paths between two switches, only one can be active at any time. As a result, paths often become oversubscribed. Conversely, spine-leaf architectures rely on protocols such as Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMPM) routing to load balance traffic across all available paths while still preventing network loops.\nIn addition to higher performance, spine-leaf topologies provide better scalability. Additional spine switches can be added and connected to every leaf, increasing capacity. Likewise, new leaf switches can be seamlessly inserted when port density becomes a problem. In either case, this \u0026ldquo;scale-out\u0026rdquo; of infrastructure does not require any re-architecting of the network, and there is no downtime.\nBack to Index\n"

Extending the implementation of the LAG to more than a single device provides yet another level of redundancy that extends from the link level to the node level.

MLAG VIP is important for retrieving peer information.\nNOTE: If you have a mgmt0 interface, the IP address should be within the subnet of the management interface. Do not use mgmt1. The management network is used for keepalive messages between the switches. The MLAG domain must be unique name for each MLAG domain.

CANU can automatically parse CSI output or the Shasta SLS API for switch IPv4 addresses.\nCSI Input  In order to parse CSI output, use the --csi-folder FOLDER flag to pass in the folder where the sls_input_file.json file is located.  The sls_input_file.json file is generally stored in one of two places depending on how far the system is in the install process.\nEarly in the install process, when running off of the LiveCD the sls_input_file.json file is normally found in the the directory /var/www/ephemeral/prep/SYSTEMNAME/\nLater in the install process, the sls_input_file.json file is generally in /mnt/pitdata/prep/SYSTEMNAME/\nTo get the switch IP addresses from CSI output, run the command:\ncanu -s 1.4 init --csi-folder /CSI/OUTPUT/FOLDER/ADDRESS --out output.txt 8 IP addresses saved to output.txt\nSLS API Input To parse the Shasta SLS API for IP addresses, ensure that you have a valid token. The token file can either be passed in with the --auth-token TOKEN_FILE flag, or it can be automatically read if the environmental variable SLS_TOKEN is set. The SLS address is default set to api-gw-service-nmn.local, if you are operating on a system with a different address, you can set it with the --sls-address SLS_ADDRESS flag.\nTo get the switch IP addresses from the Shasta SLS API, run the command:\ncanu -s 1.4 init --auth-token ~./config/cray/tokens/ --sls-address 1.2.3.4 --out output.txt The output file for the canu init command is set with the --out FILENAME flag.\nBack to Index\n"

	"content": "Management Network User Guide Introduction The intent for the this documentation is to help install and manage Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox network switches in a CSM install.\nThe HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is via the CANU tool, hence this guide will not go to level of detail of how to configure each switch via CLI in the topology, rather give you helpful examples of how to configure/use features generated by CANU to provide administrators easy way to customize their installation.\nAlso included in this guide are our current documented and supported network scenarios. Please do note that not every configuration option is covered here and for any configuration outside of the scope of this document; You should refer to the official Aruba user manuals.\nThis document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.\n The display and command line illustrated in this document are examples and might not exactly match your particular environment. The switch and accessory drawings in this document are for illustration only, and may not exactly match your installed products.\n Switch Configuration Guides Switch Config States To check what state the switches are see the upgrade page.\n 1.0 Config: Non generated switch configs. 1.2 Preconfig: CANU generated configs for 1.0 1.2 Config: CANU generated configs for 1.2  Starting Points  Current switch configs are not generated and need to upgrade to generated configs.  This can either be 1.0 generated or 1.2 generated. upgrade   Current switch configs are generated and need to go to 1.2.  1.2 (Preconfig) to 1.2   Switches have no config on them.  Fresh Install   Reinstalling the same CSM version.  Re-install   New hardware was added to the system.  Added Hardware   Switch failed and needs to be replaced.  Replace Switch    User guides The user guides contain information such as are generic configuration examples, explanation of currently used technologies, topology maps and summary of the network design used in the CSM management network.\n Aruba Dell Mellanox  CANU CSM Automatic Network Utility (CANU) is the tool used to generate/validate/test the Shasta management network.\nDocumentation for CANU can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu\nUseful Pages  Collect data  Input data needed to generate switch configs.   Cable Management Network Servers  Shows how servers in CSM should be cabled.   SHCD HMN Tab/HMN Connections Rules  Shows how the HMN tab on the SHCD should be formatted.   SHCD Connection Rules  Shows how the all tabs on the SHCD should be formatted EXCEPT the HMN tab.   Backup Custom Config  Shows users how to backup configuration that is custom to their system; this includes site connections and credentials.   Configuration Management  Shows users how to save a running config to the switch for backup purposes or to switch between different switch configs.   Validate Switch Config  Compares the configuration on a running system to what is generated.   Wipe Management Switches  Erase the switch configuration, this is useful for fresh installs.   Generate Switch Configs  Generate configurations for all management switches.   Manual Switch Configs  Some configuration needs to be done manually (authentication/SNMP).   Validate SHCD  Validate the SHCD against the CSM network architecture.

All firmware can be found in the HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\nSwitch Firmware    Model software version     Aruba 8320 Switch Series 10.09.0010   Aruba 8325 Switch Series 10.09.0010   Aruba 8360 Switch Series 10.09.0010   Aruba 6300 Switch Series 10.09.0010   Mellanox SN2100 Switch Series 3.9.3210   Mellanox SN2700 Switch Series 3.9.3210   Dell S3048-ON Switch Series 10.5.1.4   Dell S4148T-ON Switch Series 10.5.1.4   Dell S4148F-ON Switch Series 10.5.1.4    Aruba Firmware Best Practices Aruba software version number explained:\nFor example: 10.06.0120\n  10\t= OS\n  06\t= Major branch (new features)\n  0120\t= CPE release (bug fixes)\n  It is considered to be a best practice to keep all Aruba CX platform devices running the same software version.\nAruba CX devices two software image banks, which means sw images can be pre-staged to the device without booting to the new image.\nIf upgrading to a new major branch, in Aruba identified by the second integer in the software image number.\nWhen upgrading past a major software release, for example, from 10.6 to 10.8 (and skipping 10.7), issue the allow-unsafe-upgrades command to allow any low level firmware/driver upgrades to complete. If going from the 10.6 branch to 10.7 branch, this step can be skipped as the low level firmware/driver upgrade would be automatically completed.\nsw-leaf-001# config sw-leaf-001(config)# allow-unsafe-updates 30 This command will enable non-failsafe updates of programmable devices for the next 30 minutes. First, wait for all line and fabric modules to reach the ready state, and then reboot the switch to begin applying any needed updates. Ensure that the switch will not lose power, be rebooted again, or have any modules removed until all updates have finished and all line and fabric modules have returned to the ready state.\nWARNING: Interrupting these updates may make the product unusable!\nContinue (y/n)? y Unsafe updates : allowed (less than 30 minute(s) remaining) VSX software upgrade command can automatically upgrade both of the peers in VSX topology by staging upgrade and automatically doing traffic shifting between peers to minimize impact to network.

	"content": "Virtual Switching Framework (VSF) - 6300 Only Virtual Switching Framework (VSF) defines a virtual switch comprised of multiple individual physical switches, inter-connected through standard Ethernet links. These physical switches will operate with one control plane, thereby visible to the peers as a virtual switch stack.\nWithin the stack, one switch is the \u0026ldquo;Master\u0026rdquo; switch, which runs all the control plane software and manages the ASICs of all the stack members. A second switch can be configured as the \u0026ldquo;Standby\u0026rdquo; switch, which will take over as master if the master fails.\nEach stack member must have a unique member number. While deploying a stack, the user must ensure that each member has a distinct member number by renumbering the switches to desired member numbers. Stack formation will fail if there is a member number conflict.\nA primary member will become master under normal circumstances (no member / link failures). The secondary member will become standby member under normal circumstances.\nThe primary member is member number 1. This is not configurable. Also note that 1 is the default member number. A factory-default switch boots up as a VSF-enabled switch, with member number \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;. It behaves as a 1-member stack, of which it is master.\nThe secondary member number is user configurable, and there is no default secondary member. It is strongly recommended that the customer configure a secondary member in the stack, because a stack with a standby offers resiliency and high-availability.\nOther than the primary and secondary members, no members can ever become master / standby of the stack.\nConfiguration Commands Create a VSF member:\nswitch(config)# vsf member \u0026lt;ID\u0026gt; switch(vsf-member)# link \u0026lt;ID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;IFACE-RANGE\u0026gt; Show commands to validate functionality:\nswitch# show vsf \u0026lt;brief|configuration|status\u0026gt; Example Output switch# show vsf topology Stby Master CPU Utilization Memory Utilization : 15% VSF link 1 : Down VSF link 2 : Down +---+ +---+ +---+ | 3 |1==2| 2 |1==1| 1 | +---+ +---+ +---+ Back to Index\n"

	"content": "What is VSX? Enterprise networks face the challenge of delivering 24x7 always-on reliable access and cloud-based services. As a business and network grows, this non-stop availability becomes more critical due to simple economics. Downtime leads to a loss of productivity, user satisfaction and revenue.\nSwitches in the campus and data center sit at the heart of the network and are responsible for the delivery of a high availability (HA) solution that is capable of ensuring always-on access with robust performance.\nTo address this requirement, Aruba\u0026rsquo;s Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) has been designed from the ground up to provide industry-leading performance and high availability with much-needed simplicity. This is accomplished through the resiliency of AOS-CX, a modern network operating system that performs continuous state synchronization.\nWhat are the Benefits of VSX? No downtime, even during upgrades.\nHigh-availability (HA) refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for extended periods of time. For organizations today, this translates to 24x7 uptime, without disruption to network access or performance.\nPlanning for high availability of campus and data center switches involves complex tasks for addressing backup and failover processing. This includes copying and accessing the real-time networking state, including routing and forwarding tables.\nAruba VSX takes a new and innovative approach to solving high availability challenges by combining the best aspects of existing HA technologies such as multi-chassis link aggregation (MC-LAG) and equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. This combination provides a distributed and redundant architecture that is highly available, with minimal to zero traffic loss, even during software upgrades.\nAruba VSX benefits:\n HA design with live upgrades and no downtime Built for redundancy across campus and data center networks Continuous config synchronization via AOS-CX Flexible active-active network designs at L2 and L3 Operational simplicity for configuration and troubleshooting  Thanks to its design principles, VSX also supports live upgrades, delivering on the promise of in-service software upgrades where no maintenance windows are required. Within an hour, core and aggregation switches in the campus and top of rack (ToR) switches in the data center can be successfully upgraded while continuously delivering high-performing network services, without compromise.\nVSX Summary HA is a must-have requirement at the core and aggregation layers of campus networks, as well as within leaf-spine architectures in data centers. Aruba\u0026rsquo;s Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) is designed from the ground up to deliver the availability, virtualization, and simplicity required at these mission-critical layers of the network. Our goal is to offer operators a better way to ensure business success with a network that is always available, even during upgrades.\nBack to Index\n"

Traditionally, data center networks were based on a three-tier model:\n Access switches connect to servers Aggregation or distribution switches provide redundant connections to access switches Core switches provide fast transport between aggregation switches, typically connected in a redundant pair for high availability  At the most basic level, a spine-leaf architecture collapses one of these tiers, as depicted in these diagrams.\nOther common differences in spine-leaf topologies include:\n The removal of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) where feasible A scale-out vs. scale-up of infrastructure  Why are Spine-Leaf Architectures Becoming More Popular? Given the prevalence of cloud and containerized infrastructure in modern data centers, east-west traffic continues to increase. East-west traffic moves laterally, from server to server. This shift is primarily explained by modern applications having components that are distributed across more servers or VMs.\nWith east-west traffic, having low-latency, optimized traffic flows is imperative for performance, especially for time-sensitive or data-intensive applications. A spine-leaf architecture aids this by ensuring traffic is always the same number of hops from its next destination, so latency is lower and predictable.\nCapacity also improves because STP is no longer required or at least the impact zones of STP can be limited to the edge. While STP enables redundant paths between two switches, only one can be active at any time. As a result, paths often become oversubscribed. Conversely, spine-leaf architectures rely on protocols such as Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMPM) routing to load balance traffic across all available paths while still preventing network loops.\nIn addition to higher performance, spine-leaf topologies provide better scalability. Additional spine switches can be added and connected to every leaf, increasing capacity. Likewise, new leaf switches can be seamlessly inserted when port density becomes a problem. In either case, this \u0026ldquo;scale-out\u0026rdquo; of infrastructure does not require any re-architecting of the network, and there is no downtime.\nBack to Index\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Queuing and Scheduling When defining end-to-end behavior via CoS or DSCP, different priorities of traffic must be placed in different queues so the network device can service them appropriately. Separate queues allow delay- or jitter-sensitive traffic to be serviced before bulk or less time-critical traffic.\nQueue policies configure which queues the different priorities of traffic will use. Queues are numbered in priority order, with zero being the lowest priority. The larger the queue number, the higher the priority of that queue.\nSchedule policies configure the order of the queues from which packets are removed (de-queued) for transmitting. The schedule discipline is the algorithm the scheduler employs each round it must select the next packet for transmission. The supported scheduling disciplines are:\n Strict priority (SP): This is the simplest of scheduling disciplines. For each round, the scheduler will choose the highest-priority queue when removing packets for transmission. While this does provide prioritization of traffic, when spikes of high-priority traffic occur, it will prevent lower-priority traffic from being transmitted (queue starvation). Weighted fair queuing (WFQ): Weighted fair queuing can limit queue starvation by providing a fairer distribution of available bandwidth across the priorities. Lower-priority queues will have some service even when packets are present in higher-priority queues, depending on the weights assigned to each queue; the larger the weight, the greater the potential amount of service. WFQ accommodates variable traffic and services each packet as fairly as possible.

You will have to re-apply it.\n NOTE: These are example configs only, most implementations of Bi-CAN will be different.\n Example Aruba primary configuration:\ninterface vlan 7 vsx-sync active-gateways vrf attach CAN description CAN ip mtu 9198 ip address 128.55.176.2/23 active-gateway ip mac 12:00:00:00:6b:00 active-gateway ip 128.55.176.1 ip ospf 2 area 0.0.0.210 Example Aruba secondary configuration:\ninterface vlan 7 vsx-sync active-gateways vrf attach CAN description CAN ip mtu 9198 ip address 128.55.176.3/23 active-gateway ip mac 12:00:00:00:6b:00 active-gateway ip 128.55.176.1 ip ospf 2 area 0.0.0.210   Create a new BGP process in CAN VRF.\nA new BGP process will need to be running in the CAN VRF, this will peer with the CAN IP addresses on the NCN workers.\nThese are example configs only.

There are three types of classes – MAC, IPv4, and IPv6 – which are each focused on relevant frame/packet characteristics.

When that is the case, CANU looks up the MAC in the ARP table and displays the IP addresses and vlan information associated with the MAC.\nEntries in the table will be colored based on what they are. For example: Neighbors that have ncn in their name will be colored blue. Neighbors that have a port labeled (not a MAC address), are generally switches and are labeled green. Ports that are duplicated, will be bright white.\nCheck Cabling of Multiple Switches The cabling of multiple Aruba switches on a network can be checked at the same time using LLDP. The IPv4 addresses of the switches can either be entered comma-separated, or be read from a file. To enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses to the ---ips flag. To read the IP addresses from a file, make sure the file has one IP address per line, and use the flag like --ips-file FILENAME to input the file.\nAn example of checking the cabling of multiple switches:\ncanu --shasta 1.5 network cabling --ips 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2 --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD There are two different --view options, switch and equipment:\n --view switch option: Displays a table for every switch IP address passed in showing connections. This is the same view as shown in the above example of checking single switch cabling. --view equipment option: Displays a table for each mac address connection. This means that servers and switches will both display incoming and outgoing connections.  An example of checking the cabling of multiple switches and displaying with the equipment view:\ncanu --shasta 1.5 network cabling --ips 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2 --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --view equipment` canu --shasta 1.4 network cabling --ips 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2 --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --view equipment Expected results:\nsw-spine01 Aruba JL635A GL.10.06.0010 aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/1/1 \u0026lt;==\u0026gt; sw-spine02 1/1/1 Aruba JL635A GL.10.06.0010 1/1/3 ===\u0026gt; 00:00:00:00:00:00 mgmt1 1/1/4 ===\u0026gt; ncn-test bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb mgmt1 Linux ncn-test sw-spine02 Aruba JL635A GL.10.06.0010 bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/1/1 \u0026lt;==\u0026gt; sw-spine01 1/1/1 Aruba JL635A GL.10.06.0010 00:00:00:00:00:00 192.168.2.2:vlan3, 192.168.1.2:vlan1  Validate SHCD CANU can be used to validate that an SHCD (Shasta Cabling Diagram) passes basic validation checks.\n The --architecture / -a flag is used to set the architecture of the system, either TDS, or Full.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Gateway Testing With the introduction of BiCAN, service APIs are now available on one or more networks depending on who is allowed access to the services and from where. The services are accessed via three different ingress gateways using a token that can be retrieved from Keycloak.\nThis page describes how to run a set of tests that determine if the gateways are functioning properly. The gateway test will obtain an API token from Keycloak and then use that token to attempt to access a set of service APIs on one or more networks, as defined in the gateway test definition file (gateway-test-defn.yaml). The test will check the return code to make sure it gets the expected response.\nWhen the nmnlb network is specified, the test will use api-gw-service-nmn.local as an override for nmnlb.\u0026lt;system-domain\u0026gt; in CSM v1.2. Optionally, setting use-api-gw-override: false in gateway-test-defn.yaml disables that override, and the test will use nmnlb.\u0026lt;system-domain\u0026gt;.\nRunning gateway tests on an NCN The gateway test scripts can be found in /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test. When gateway-test.py is run from an NCN, it has access to the admin client secret using kubectl. It will use the admin client secret to get the token for accessing the APIs.\nExecute the test by running following command. The system domain (in this example, eniac.dev.cray.com) must be specified.\nncn# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/gateway-test.py eniac.dev.cray.com The test will cycle through all of the test networks specified in gateway-test-defn.yaml.\ntest-networks: - name: nmnlb gateway: services-gateway - name: cmn gateway: services-gateway - name: can gateway: customer-user-gateway - name: chn gateway: customer-user-gateway For each network, the test will attempt to obtain a token from Keycloak. On an NCN, it should be able to get a token from each of those networks. It will then use that token to attempt to access each of the services defined in gateway-test-defn.yaml, on each of the test-networks. The test will determine whether it should or should not be able to access the service, and it will output a PASS or FAIL for each service, as appropriate.\nRunning gateway tests from UAN, Compute Node, or a device outside of the cluster The following steps must be performed on the system where the test is to be run:\n  python3 must be installed (if it is not already).\n  Obtain the test code.\nThere are two options for doing this:\n  Install the docs-csm RPM.\nSee Check for Latest Documentation.\n  Copy over the following files from a system where the docs-csm RPM is installed:\n /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/gateway-test.py /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/gateway-test-defn.yaml      Obtain the admin client secret.\nBecause we do not have access to kubectl outside of the cluster, obtain the admin client secret by running the following command on an NCN.\nncn# kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.client-secret}\u0026#39; | base64 -d 26947343-d4ab-403b-14e937dbd700   Export the admin client secret in an environment variable.\nBack on the system where the tests will be run, set and export the ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable, using the admin-client-auth secret obtained in the previous step:\nlinux# export ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET=26947343-d4ab-403b-14e937dbd700   Execute the test.\nExecute the test by running following command. The system domain (in this example, eniac.dev.cray.com) must be specified.\nlinux# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/gateway-test.py eniac.dev.cray.com   Running gateway tests on a UAI In order to test the gateways from a UAI, the /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/uai-gateway-test.sh script is used.\nThis script will execute the following steps:\n Create a UAI with a cray-uai-gateway-test image. Pass the system domain, user network, and admin client secret to the test UAI. Execute gateway-test.py on the node. Output the results. Delete the test UAI.  Run the test by executing the following command.\nncn# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/gateway-test/uai-gateway-test.sh The test will find the first UAI cray-uai-gateway-test image to create the test UAI. A different image may optionally be specified by using the --imagename option.\nExample Results The results of running the tests will show the following\n Retrieval of a token on the CMN network; the token is used to get SLS data, which determines which networks are defined on the system. For each of the test networks defined in gateway-test-defn.yaml:  Retrieval of a token on the network under test. It will attempt to access each of the services with the token and check the expected results.  It will show PASS or FAIL depending on the expected response for the service and the token being used. It will show SKIP for services that are not expected to be installed on the system.     The return code of gateway-test.py will be non-zero if any of the tests within it fail, or if it is unable to retrieve a token on any of the networks that are expected to be accessible.

	"content": "Management Network 1.0 (1.2 Preconfig) to 1.2 Prerequisites  System is already running with CANU generated 1.0 configurations (1.2 Preconfig). Generated Switch configurations for 1.2.  Generate Switch Config   CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.  Run canu --version to see version. If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see this procedure: Update CANU From CSM Tarball    Be sure that your current connection to the system is not through the Spine switches. If it is and you perform this upgrade you will lose connection to the system.\n To verify this, check the default route from the NCN that has the site connection.  ncn-m001# ip r default via 10.102.3.1 dev vlan007  If the default route is out the site connection, then you should be able to skip the rest of the procedure. A default route going out the site connection would look similar to below.  ncn-m001# ip r default via 172.30.48.1 dev lan0  If the default route is through dev vlan007 or the CAN VLAN, this needs to change so we do not lose connection when moving this VLAN to the Customer VRF on the switches. In this example the site connection is on lan0  ncn-m001# ip a show lan0 29: lan0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether b4:2e:99:3a:26:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 172.30.52.183/20 brd 172.30.63.255 scope global lan0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::b62e:99ff:fe3a:2608/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever  The default route needs to replaced to route out lan0 Replace the default route with the correct next-hop router for this network.  ncn-m001# ip route replace default via 172.30.48.1 Mellanox Use CANU Validate to see the differences between the 1.0 and 1.2 switch configurations.\nncn-m001# canu validate switch config --running ./1.0/sw-spine-002.cfg --generated ./1.2/sw-spine-002.cfg --vendor mellanox --remediation Output\n- vlan 7 name \u0026#34;CAN\u0026#34;

Some services may require a JSON Web Token (JWT) to access them, while others may require Keycloak to login using a DC LDAP password.\nThe following services are currently available:\n HPE Cray EX API (requires valid JWT) Keycloak Ceph RADOS gateway (requires valid JWT) Nexus System Management Health Prometheus (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) System Management Health Grafana (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) System Management Health Alertmanager (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) Kiali, for Istio service mesh visibility (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) Jaeger, for Istio tracing (redirects to Keycloak for SSO)  In general, external hostnames should resolve to a CAN external IP address for the following services:\n istio-system/istio-ingressgateway-can - Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway. services/cray-keycloak-gatekeeper-ingress - Keycloak Gatekeeper\u0026rsquo;s ingress reverse proxy that redirects browsers to Keycloak for log in, and then to Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway with a valid JWT for authorized access.  This can be verified using the dig command to resolve the external hostname and compare it with Kubernetes.\nWhat Happens if External DNS is not Used? Without forwarding to External DNS, administrators will not have the ability to use the externally exposed services, such as Prometheus, Grafana, the HPE Cray EX REST API, and more. See Externally Exposed Services for more information.\nAccessing most of these services by IP address will not work because the Ingress Gateway uses the name to direct requests to the appropriate service.\nDNS for HPE Cray EX Systems There is a separate set of DNS instances within HPE Cray EX that is used by the nodes and pods within the system for resolving names.\n  Unbound\nThe unbound DNS instance is used to resolve names for the physical equipment on the management networks within HPE Cray EX, such as NCNs, UANs, switches, compute nodes, and more. This instance is accessible only within the system.\n  K8s CoreDNS\nThere is a CoreDNS instance within Kubernetes that is used by Kubernetes pods to resolve names for internal pods and services. This instance is accessible only within the HPE Cray EX Kubernetes cluster.\n  Connect Customer DNS to External DNS The DNS instance at the customer site should use DNS forwarding to forward the subdomain specified by the system-name and site-domain values (combined to make the system-name.site-domain value) to the IP address specified by the cmn-external-dns value. These values are defined with the csi config init command. The specifics on how to do the forwarding configuration is dependent on the type of DNS used by the customer.\nThe External DNS instance currently does not support zone transfer.\n"

	"content": "External DNS Failing to Discover Services Workaround Many external DNS issues can be worked around by directly connecting to the desired backend service. This can circumvent authentication and authorization protections, but it may be necessary to access specific services when mitigating critical issues.\nIstio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway uses Gateway and VirtualService objects to configure how traffic is routed to backend services. Currently, there are three gateways supporting the externally accessible services. They are services-gateway, customer-admin-gateway and customer-user-gateway. They are configured to support traffic on any host depending on the network over which the services are accessed. It is the VirtualService objects that ultimately control routing based on hostname.\nUse this procedure to resolve any external DNS routing issues with backend services.\nPrerequisites This procedure requires administrative privileges.\nProcedure   Search for the VirtualService object that corresponds to the desired service.\nThe command below will list all external hostnames.\nncn-w001# kubectl get vs -A | grep -v \u0026#39;[*]\u0026#39; Example output:\nNAMESPACE NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE istio-system kiali [services/services-gateway] [kiali-istio.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h istio-system tracing [services/services-gateway] [jaeger-istio.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h nexus nexus [services/services-gateway] [packages.local registry.local nexus.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services gitea-vcs-external [services/services-gateway] [vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services sma-grafana [services-gateway] [sma-grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services sma-kibana [services-gateway] [sma-kibana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-alertmanager [services/services-gateway] [alertmanager.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-grafana [services/services-gateway] [grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus [services/services-gateway] [prometheus.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h   Inspect the VirtualService object(s) to learn the destination service and port.\nUse the NAME value returned in the previous step.

Browser sessions are automatically configured to use a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authorization to Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway, enabling a central enforcement point of Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for system management traffic.\nThe OAuth2 Proxy will inject HTTP headers so that an upstream endpoint can identify the user and customize access as needed. To enable ingress via OAuth2 Proxy external hostnames, web apps need to be added to the proxiedWebAppExternalHostnames for the appropriate ingress (customerManagement, customerAccess, or customerHighSpeed) in customizations.yaml (i.e sma-grafana.{{ network.dns.external }}).\n"

	"content": "Troubleshoot DNS Configuration Issues Troubleshoot issues when DNS is not properly configured to delegate name resolution to the core DNS instance on a specific cluster. Although the CMN/CAN/CHN IP address may still be routable using the IP address directly, it may not work because Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway depends on the hostname (or SNI) to route traffic. For command line tools like cURL, using the \u0026ndash;resolve option to force correct resolution can be used to work around this issue.\nTo get names to resolve correctly in a browser, modifying /etc/hosts to map the external hostname to the appropriate CMN/CAN/CHN IP address may be necessary. In either case, knowing the correct CMN/CAN/CHN IP address is required to use the cURL --resolve option or to update /etc/hosts.\nAssuming CMN/CAN/CHN, BGP, MetalLB, and external DNS are properly configured on a system, name resolution requests can be sent directly to the desired DNS server.\nGain access to system services when external DNS is not configured properly.\nPrerequisites The Domain Name Service (DNS) is not configured properly.\nProcedure   View the DNS configuration on the system.\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services get svc cray-dns-powerdns-cmn-udp Example output:\nNAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE cray-dns-powerdns-cmn-udp LoadBalancer 10.25.156.88 10.101.5.61 53:32674/UDP 45h   Confirm that DNS is configured properly.\nRun the following command from a laptop or workstation.\n$ dig SERVICE.NETWORK.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME +short If an IP address is returned, DNS is configured properly and the remaining steps in this procedure can be skipped. If an IP address is not returned, proceed to the next step.\n  Use the IP address to direct DNS requests directly to the cray-dns-powerdns-cmn-udp service.\nReplace the example IP address (10.101.5.61) with the EXTERNAL-IP value returned in step 1. If an IP address is returned, it means upstream IT DNS is not configured correctly.\n$ dig SERVICE.NETWORK.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME +short @10.101.5.61   Direct DNS requests to the cluster IP address from an NCN.\nReplace the example cluster IP address (10.25.156.88) with the CLUSTER-IP value returned in step 1. If an IP address is returned, external DNS is configured on the cluster and something is likely wrong with CMN/CAN/CHN/BGP.\nncn-w001# dig SERVICE.NETWORK.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME +short @10.25.156.88   Access services in the event that external DNS is down, the backing etcd database is having issues, or something was configured incorrectly.\nSearch through Kubernetes service objects for external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname annotations to find the corresponding external IP. The kubectl command makes it easy to generate an /etc/hosts compatible listing of IP addresses to hostnames using the go-template output format shown below.\nncn-m001# kubectl get svc --all-namespaces -o go-template --template \\ \u0026#39;{{ range .items }}{{ $lb := .status.loadBalancer }}{{ with .metadata.annotations }} {{ with (index . \u0026#34;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname\u0026#34;) }} {{ $hostnames := . }}{{ with $lb }}{{ range .ingress }} {{ printf \u0026#34;%s\\t%s\\n\u0026#34; .ip $hostnames }}{{ end }}{{ end }} {{ end }}{{ end }}{{ end }}\u0026#39; | sort -u | tr , \u0026#39; \u0026#39; Example output:\n10.101.5.128 opa-gpm.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME jaeger-istio.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME kiali-istio.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME prometheus.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME alertmanager.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME sma-grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME sma-kibana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME csms.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME 10.101.5.129 api.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME auth.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME nexus.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME 10.101.5.130 s3.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME 10.92.100.71 api.nmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME auth.nmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME 10.92.100.222 cray-dhcp-kea 10.92.100.225 cray-dns-unbound 10.94.100.222 cray-dhcp-kea 10.94.100.225 cray-dns-unbound   "

	"content": "Domain Name Service (DNS) Overview DNS Architecture This diagram shows how the various components of the DNS infrastructure interact.\nDNS Components The DNS infrastructure is comprised of a number of components.\nUnbound (cray-dns-unbound) Unbound is a caching DNS resolver which is also used as the primary DNS server.\nThe DNS records served by Unbound include system component names (xnames), node hostnames, and service names and these records are read from the cray-dns-unbound ConfigMap which is populated by cray-dns-unbound-manager.\nThe DNS server functionality will be migrated to PowerDNS in a future release leaving Unbound acting purely as a caching DNS resolver.\nUnbound also forwards queries to PowerDNS or the site DNS server if the query cannot be answered by local data.\nUnbound Manager (cray-dns-unbound-manager) The cray-dns-unbound-manager cron job runs every three minutes and queries the System Layout Service, the Hardware State Manager, and the Kea DHCP server for new or changed hardware components and creates DNS records for these components in the cray-dns-unbound ConfigMap.\nThis job also initiates a rolling restart of Unbound if the cray-dns-unbound ConfigMap was modified.\nKubernetes DNS (coredns) Kubernetes creates DNS records for services and pods. A CoreDNS server running in the kube-system namespace is used for this purpose.\nThe CoreDNS service is also configured to forward DNS requests to Unbound in order to allow pods to resolve system hardware components and other services. This configuration is performed by the cray-dns-unbound-coredns job which is invoked whenever the cray-dns-unbound Helm chart is deployed or upgraded.\nSee the Kubernetes documentation for more information.\nExternalDNS (cray-externaldns-external-dns) ExternalDNS creates DNS records for services that are intended to be accessible via the Customer Access Network (CAN), Customer Management Network (CMN), and Customer High-Speed Network (CHN). For example grafana.cmn.wasp.dev.cray.com.\nKubernetes Services annotated with external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname have DNS records created.\nStarting with CSM version 1.1 these DNS records are created in the PowerDNS server. Earlier versions of CSM used a dedicated CoreDNS server for ExternalDNS.\n Only DNS A records are created as ExternalDNS currently does not support the creation of the PTR records required for reverse lookup.\n PowerDNS (cray-dns-powerdns) PowerDNS is an authoritative DNS server which over the next few CSM releases will replace Unbound sa the primary DNS server within a CSM system.\nPowerDNS is able to respond to queries for services accessible via the CAN, CMN, or CHN. Records are externally accessible via the LoadBalancer IP address specified for the CSI --cmn-external-dns option.\nAs with earlier CSM releases it is possible to delegate to PowerDNS to resolve services and it is also possible to configure zone transfer to sync the DNS records from PowerDNS to Site DNS.\nPowerDNS Manager (cray-powerdns-manager) The PowerDNS Manager serves a similar purpose to the Unbound Manager. It runs in the background and periodically queries the System Layout Service, the Hardware State Manager, and the Kea DHCP server for new or changed hardware components and creates DNS records for these components in PowerDNS.\nThe PowerDNS Manager also configures the PowerDNS server for zone transfer and DNSSEC if required.\nSite DNS This term is used to refer the external DNS server specified the CSI --site-dns option.\n"

Typically, any error seen in Unbound, including the example above, falls under one of two categories:   A bad configuration can come from a misconfiguration in the Helm chart. Currently, only the site/external DNS lookup can be at fault.\nACTION: See the customization.yaml file and look at the system_to_site_lookup value(s). Ensure that the external lookup values are valid and working.\n  Bad data (as shown in the above example) comes only from the DNS Helper and can be seen in the manager logs.\nACTION: Review and troubleshoot the Manager Logs as shown below.\n    View Manager (DNS Helper) Logs Manager logs will show the status of the latest \u0026ldquo;true up\u0026rdquo; of DNS with respect to DHCP actual leases and SLS/SMD status. The following command shows the last four lines of the last Manager run, and can be adjusted as needed.\nncn-w001# kubectl logs -n services pod/$(kubectl get -n services pods \\ | grep unbound | tail -n 1 | cut -f 1 -d \u0026#39; \u0026#39;) -c manager | tail -n4 Example output:\nuid: bc1e8b7f-39e2-49e5-b586-2028953d2940 Comparing new and existing DNS records. No differences found. Skipping DNS update Any log with ERROR or Exception is an indication that DNS is not healthy. The above example includes one of two possible reports for a healthy manager run. The healthy states are described below, as long as the write to the ConfigMap has not failed:\n No differences found. Skipping DNS update Differences found. Writing new DNS records to our configmap.  Troubleshooting: The Manager runs periodically, about every minute in release v1.4. Check if this is a one-time occurrence or if it is a recurring issue.\n If the error shows in one Manager log, but not during the next one, this is likely a one-time failure. Check to see if the record exists in DNS, and if so, move on. If several or all Manager logs show errors, particularly the same error, this could be of several sources:   Bad network connections to DHCP and/or SLS/SMD.\nACTION: Capture as much log data as possible and contact customer support.\n  Bad data from DHCP and/or SLS/SMD.\nACTION: If connections to DHCP (Kea) are involved, refer to Troubleshoot DHCP Issues.\n    Restart Unbound If any errors discovered in the sections above have been deemed transient or have not been resolved, the Unbound pods can be restarted.\nUse the following command to restart the pods:\n  Restart Unbound\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-dns-unbound   A rolling restart of the Unbound pods will occur, old pods will not be terminated and new pods will not be added to the load balancer until the new pods have successfully loaded the DNS records.\nClear Bad Data in the Unbound ConfigMap Unbound stores records it obtains from DHCP, SLS, and SMD via the Manager job in a ConfigMap. It is possible to clear this ConfigMap and allow the next Manager job to regenerate the content.\nThis is useful in the following cases:\n A transient failure in any Unbound process or required services has left the configuration data in a bad state. SLS and SMD data needed to be reset because of bad or incorrect data there. DHCP (Kea) has been restarted to clear errors.  The following clears the (DNS Helper) Manager generated data in the ConfigMap. This is generally safe as Unbound runtime data is held elsewhere.\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services patch configmaps cray-dns-unbound \\ --type merge -p \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;binaryData\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;records.json.gz\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;H4sICLQ/Z2AAA3JlY29yZHMuanNvbgCLjuUCAETSaHADAAAA\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; "

If the Customer Access Network (CAN) is not configured on the system, these services will need to be pinned to ncn-m001 because that is the only node that has external access. See Customer Access Network (CAN) for more implications if CAN is not configured.\nThe label used for scheduling these services is no_external_access:\n If the no_external_access label is applied to a node with the value True, then any pods that require outside access will not be scheduled on that node.

Therefore, if CAN is not configured on the system, the label no_external_access=True must be applied to all NCN master and worker nodes other than ncn-m001.\nBefore Installation The label can be configured by setting the following values to True in the customizations.yaml file.

	"content": "Troubleshoot CAN Issues Various connection points to check when using the CAN and how to fix any issues that arise.\nThe most frequent issue with the Customer Access Network (CAN) is trouble accessing IP addresses outside of the HPE Cray EX system from a node or pod inside the system.\nThe best way to resolve this issue is to try to ping an outside IP address from one of the NCNs other than ncn-m001, which has a direct connection that it can use instead of the Customer Access Network (CAN). The following are some things to check to make sure CAN is configured correctly:\nDoes the NCN have an IP Address Configured on the bond0.cmn0 Interface? Check the status of the bond0.cmn0 interface. Make sure it has an address specified.\nncn-w002# ip addr show bond0.cmn0 Example output:\n534: bond0.cmn0@bond0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 98:03:9b:b4:27:62 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 10.102.5.5/26 brd 10.101.8.255 scope global bond0.cmn0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::9a03:9bff:feb4:2762/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever If there is not an address specified, make sure the can- values have been defined in csi config init input.\nDoes the NCN have a Default Gateway Configured? Check the default route on an NCN other than ncn-m001. There should be a default route with a gateway matching the can-gateway value.\nncn-w002# ip route | grep default Example output:\ndefault via 10.102.5.27 dev bond0.cmn0 If there is not an address specified, make sure the can- values have been defined in csi config init input.\nCan the Node Reach the Default CAN Gateway? Check that the node can ping the default gateway shown in the default route.\nncn-w002# ping 10.102.5.27 Example output:\nPING 10.102.5.27 (10.102.5.27) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.148 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.107 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.133 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.122 ms ^C --- 10.102.5.27 ping statistics --- 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3053ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.107/0.127/0.148/0.018 ms If the default gateway cannot be accessed, check the spine switch configuration.\nCan the Spines Reach Outside of the System? Check that each of the spines can ping an IP address outside of the HPE Cray EX system. This must be an IP address that is reachable from the network to which the CAN is connected.

	"content": "Troubleshoot DHCP Issues There are several things to check for when troubleshooting issues with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers.\nIncorrect DHCP IP Addresses One of the most common issues is when the DHCP IP addresses are not matching in the Domain Name Service (DNS).\nCheck to make sure cray-dhcp is not running in Kubernetes:\nncn-w001# kubectl get pods -A | grep cray-dhcp Example output:\nservices cray-dhcp-5f8c8767db-hg6ch 1/1 Running 0 35d If the cray-dhcp pod is running, use the following command to shut down the pod:\nncn-w001# kubectl scale deploy cray-dhcp --replicas=0 If the IP addresses are still not lining up with DNS and cray-dhcp is confirmed not running, wait 800 seconds for DHCP leases to expire and renew.\nVerify the Status of the cray-dhcp-kea Pods and Services Check to see if the Kea DHCP services are running:\nncn-w001# kubectl get services -n services | grep kea Example output:\ncray-dhcp-kea-api ClusterIP 10.26.142.204 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8000/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres ClusterIP 10.19.97.142 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-0 ClusterIP 10.30.214.27 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-1 ClusterIP 10.27.232.156 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-2 ClusterIP 10.22.242.251 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-config ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-repl ClusterIP 10.17.107.16 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5432/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-tcp-hmn LoadBalancer 10.24.79.120 10.94.100.222 67:32120/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-tcp-nmn LoadBalancer 10.19.139.179 10.92.100.222 67:31652/TCP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-udp-hmn LoadBalancer 10.25.203.31 10.94.100.222 67:30840/UDP 5d23h cray-dhcp-kea-udp-nmn LoadBalancer 10.19.187.168 10.92.100.222 67:31904/UDP 5d23h If the services shown in the output above are not present, it could be an indication that something is not working correctly. To check to see if the Kea pods are running:\nncn-w001# kubectl get pods -n services -o wide | grep kea Example output:\ncray-dhcp-kea-788b4c899b-x6ltd 3/3 Running 0 36h 10.40.3.183 ncn-w002 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-0 2/2 Running 0 5d23h 10.40.3.121 ncn-w002 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-1 2/2 Running 0 5d23h 10.42.2.181 ncn-w003 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; cray-dhcp-kea-postgres-2 2/2 Running 0 5d23h 10.39.0.208 ncn-w001 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; The pods should be in a Running state. The output above will also indicate which worker node the kea-dhcp pod is currently running on.\nTo restart the pods:\nncn-w001# kubectl delete pods -n services -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-dhcp-kea Use the command mentioned above to verify the pods are running again after restarting the pods.\nCheck the Current DHCP Leases Use the Kea API to retrieve data from the DHCP lease database. An authentication token will be needed to access the Kea API. To retrieve a token, run the following command from an NCN worker or manager:\nncn-w001# export TOKEN=$(curl -s -k -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \\ -d client_id=admin-client -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth \\ -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.client-secret}\u0026#39; | base64 -d` \\ https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token \\ | jq -r \u0026#39;.access_token\u0026#39;) Once a token has been generated, the DHCP lease database can be viewed.

	"content": "Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority. All services and the API gateway are not dependent on any single node. This resilient arrangement ensures that services remain available during possible underlying hardware and network failures.\nAccess to individual APIs through the gateway is controlled by a policy-driven access control system. Administrators and users must retrieve a token for authentication before attempting to access APIs through the gateway and present a valid token with each API call. The authentication and authorization decisions are made at the gateway level which prevent unauthorized API calls from reaching the underlying micro-services. Refer to System Security and Authentication for more detail on the process of obtaining tokens and user management.\nReview the API documentation in the supplied container before attempting to use the API services. This container is generated with the release using the most current API descriptions in OpenAPI 2.0 format. Because this file serves as both an internal definition of the API contract and the external documentation of the API function, it is the most up-to-date reference available.\nThe API Gateway URL for accessing the APIs on a site-specific system is https://api.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME/apis/.\nThe internal URL from a local console on any of the NCNs is https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis.\n"

	"content": "CAN/CMN with Dual-Spine Configuration The Customer Access Network (CAN) and Customer Management Network (CMN) needs to be connected to both spines in a dual-spine configuration so that each spine can access the outside network. However, the NCNs should only have one default gateway. Therefore, the multi-active gateway protocol (MAGP) on the Mellanox spines can be used to create a virtual router gateway IP address that can direct to either of the spines, depending on the state of the spines. The Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) for Aruba spines serve the same purpose.\nFor more information:\n Mellanox: https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/howto-configure-magp-on-mellanox-switches Aruba: https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.04/HTML/5200-6728/index.html#book.html  The following is an example of the point-to-point configuration on the spine switches. The IP address should be replaced with the IP address chosen by the customer that matches the switch configuration.\nIn CSM 1.2 the Customer VRF is introduced, this requires the interface that is connected to the site to be configured to use this VRF.\n  Mellanox:\ninterface ethernet 1/11 speed auto force interface ethernet 1/11 description to-can interface ethernet 1/11 no switchport force interface ethernet 1/11 vrf forwarding Customer interface ethernet 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.150/30 primary   Aruba:\ninterface 1/1/36 no shutdown vrf attach Customer description to-can ip address 10.101.15.150/30 exit   There must then be two routes on the customer\u0026rsquo;s switch directing traffic for the customer_access_network and customer_management_network subnet to the endpoint on the spine switch. The following is an example of the route configuration on the customer switch.\nip route 10.103.9.0/25 10.101.15.150 ip route 10.103.9.0/25 10.101.15.152 The next hop IP address 10.101.15.150 would be the interface IP address on the Spine switch.\nThere must be a default route on each spine switch that will direct traffic that does not match other routes to the endpoint on the customer switch. The following examples are for the route configuration on sw-spine-001.\n  Mellanox:\nip route vrf Customer 0.0.0.0/0 10.101.15.149   Aruba:\nip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.101.15.149 vrf Customer   Distribution/Site Spine Switch Connection The connection between the distribution/site switch and the spines require two separate uplinks from the spine switch to the distribution switch. Two static routes need to be created on the distribution switch to route the CAN subnet to each of the spine switches. These routes will have equal cost (ECMP) to split the load across the two spines and provide redundancy if one of the spines should go down.\nExample\ninterface 1/1/41 no shutdown description WASP spine-001 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.149/30 interface 1/1/42 no shutdown description WASP spine-002 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.153/30 ip route 10.102.5/26 10.101.15.150 ip route 10.102.5/26 10.101.15.154 "

	"content": "Connect to the CAN How to connect to the CAN physically and via layer 3.\nThere are multiple ways to connect to the Customer Access Network (CAN), both physically and via a layer 3 connection.\nPhysical Connection to the CAN The physical connection to the CAN is made via the load balancer or the spine switches. The uplink connection from the system to the customer network is achieved by using the highest numbered port(s). Customer can select a single uplink port or multiple uplink ports.\nIn the example below, a Mellanox SN2700 with a single uplink connection is being used. The cable would connect to port 32 as shown in the diagram below:\nLayer 3 Connection to the CAN The CAN clients in the system require a routing topology that is setup to route traffic to the customer network. This can be done in a variety of ways and will vary depending on the system setup and configuration. The different options for connecting to the CAN from layer 3 are described below.\nOption 1: Point-to-Point\nThis option provides a point-to-point routing topology between the customer switch and the HPE Cray EX TOR Spine Switch. See CAN with Dual-Spine Configuration for more information on using this topology for a dual-spine configuration.\nThe diagram below shows how the point-to-point routing topology works:\nOption 2: Single Gateway\nThe single gateway options requires the customer to provide an IP address that is on a /24 network. This IP address will act as the gateway for traffic bound to the HPE Cray EX CAN.\nFor example, a customer could use the 192.168.30.0/24 network to connect via the HPE Cray EX CAN uplink connection. The customer also needs to provide an IP address on this network, such as 192.168.30.253. This IP address will be assigned to the uplink port on the HPE Cray EX TOR Spine Switch.\nFor a dual-spine configuration, the admin would need to extended the customer network to both switches using one IP address for each switch. After extending the network, two equal routes need to be configured. The spine switches are configured to support multi-chassis link aggregation group (MLAG) from NCNs and UANs. These nodes are configured for bonding mode layer 2 and layer 3. See CAN with Dual-Spine Configuration for more information.\nThe diagram below shows how the connection is established:\nOption 3: Customer Specific\nThe system can be setup using other customer requirements. In order to do so, the following information will be needed:\n   Item Description     Customer network IP address Specifies an IP address on the customer network that is routable to the customer network gateway   CAN IP address space Specifies a dedicated network (typically /24) that is routable from the customer network to be used for the CAN   System name Specifies the system name to be used and configured   Domain namespace extension Specifies the domain extension to be used; for example, HPE Cray EX.customer.com   Customer network IP address for ncn-m001 Specifies an IP address for administrative access on the customer network for ncn-m001   (Optional) BMC customer network IP address for ncn-m001 Specifies an IP address for BMC access on the customer network for ncn-m001    "

	"content": "Create a CSM Configuration Upgrade Plan Creating an upgrade plan is unique and dependent on the requirements of the upgrade path. Some release versions of the network configuration require coupled upgrade of software to enable new software functionality, or bug fixes that may add time required to do the full upgrade.\nFor example, in CSM release 1.2, Aruba and Mellanox switches are being upgraded to newer code.\nIn this case and cases where configuration changes are extensive, consider taking the generated configurations after review and uploading them to the switches startup config prior to booting to new code to upgrade both configuration and software simultaneously. This will prevent human error, especially from extensive changes such as modifying a high number of ports away and installing the generated configuration via the system without having to do the individual changes by hand.\nIn addition to firmware upgrade paths, the application of CANU-generated switch configurations should be carefully considered and detailed. The following are important considerations:\n Critically analyze proposed changes to ensure the customer does not have an unexpected outage. Provide a holistic upgrade plan, which includes switch-by-switch ordered changes and minimizes system outages. Typically, this should begin on the periphery of the network (leaf-bmcs) and move centrally towards spines and site uplinks. Where system outages or interruptions are expected to occur, provide details on the change order of operations, expected timing of interruptions, and guidance should the interruption be beyond expected timing.  The resulting \u0026ldquo;plan\u0026rdquo; will provide a procedure to upgrade the system from the current state to a newer version.\n"

	"content": "Customer Access Network The Customer Access Network (CAN) provides access from outside the customer network to services, non-compute nodes (NCNs), and User Access Nodes (UANs) in the system. This allows for the following:\n Clients outside of the system:  Log in to each of the NCNs and UANs. Access web UIs within the system (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, and more). Access the Rest APIs within the system. Access a DNS server within the system for resolution of names for the webUI and REST API services. Run Cray CLI commands from outside the system. Access the User Access Instances (UAI).   NCNs and UANs to access systems outside the cluster (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more). Services within the cluster to access systems outside the cluster.  These nodes and services need an IP address that routes to the customer\u0026rsquo;s network in order to be accessed from outside the network.\nImplications if CAN is not Configured  No direct access to the NCNs other than ncn-m001. Will need to hop through ncn-m001 to get to the rest of the NCNs. No direct access to the UANs unless the UAN has a direct connection to the customer network. NCNs other than ncn-m001 do not have access to services outside of the system (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more).  These nodes will not have an interface on any network with access outside of the HPE Cray EX system. These nodes will not have a default route. This includes access to any of the externally exposed services from these nodes.   Pods running on NCNs other than ncn-m001 will not have access to services outside of the system. No access to externally exposed services. See Externally Exposed Services for more information.  CAN Subnets IP addresses are allocated from a single IP subnet that is configured as the can-cidr value in the csi config init input. This subnet is further divided into three smaller subnets:\n Subnet for NCNs, UANs, and switches. Subnet for the MetalLB static pool (can-static-pool).  This is used for services that need to be pinned to the same IP address. For example, the external DNS service that needs to be configured in the upstream DNS server. This subnet currently needs only a few IP addresses.   Subnet for the MetalLB dynamic pool (can-dynamic-pool).  This is the largest subnet because it is used for most of the other services, which includes UAIs. These IP addresses can be allocated differently across deployments because these services are accessed by DNS name rather than by IP. The size of this subnet depends on how many UAI and Image Management Service (IMS) pods are needed at a given time because these IP addresses will come out of this subnet.    The minimum size for the CAN subnet is /26. The CAN /26 subnet allows for the following:\n  27 IP addresses for the NCNs, UANs, and Switches.\n  4 IP addresses for the CAN static service IP addresses.\n  32 IP addresses for the rest of the external CAN services.\nThe 32 service IP addresses will be used for the 5 standard customer-access service IP addresses and the remaining 27 IP addresses are for UAI and/or IMS services.\n  If there are more than 27 IP addresses needed for NCNs, UANs, and switches, and/or more than 32 IP addresses needed for the external CAN services, then the CAN subnet will need to be larger than a /26.\nCustomer Variables The following variables are defined in the csi config init input. This example uses values for the /26 layout described above. The can-gateway value should be an IP address at the end of the range for NCNs, UANs, and switches. For example, the IP address would be 10.102.5.27 using the figure shown above.\nlinux# csi config init Example output:\n[...] --can-cidr 10.102.5.0/26 --can-gateway 10.102.5.27 --can-static-pool 10.102.5.28/30 --can-dynamic-pool 10.102.5.32/27 --can-external-dns 10.102.5.29 --system-name testsystem --site-domain example.com [...] "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Default IP Address Ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These IP address default ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.\nThe following table shows the default IP address ranges:\n   Network IP Address Range     Kubernetes service network 10.16.0.0/12   Kubernetes pod network 10.32.0.0/12   Install Network (MTL) 10.1.0.0/16   Node Management Network (NMN) 10.252.0.0/17   High Speed Network (HSN) 10.253.0.0/16   Hardware Management Network (HMN) 10.254.0.0/17   Mountain NMN (see note below table) 10.100.0.0/17   Mountain HMN (see note below table) 10.104.0.0/17   River NMN 10.106.0.0/17   River HMN 10.107.0.0/17   Load Balanced NMN    For the Mountain NMN:     Allocate a /22 from this range per liquid-cooled cabinet. For example, the following cabinets would be given the following IP addresses in the allocated ranges:\n cabinet 1 = 10.100.0.0/22 cabinet 2 = 10.100.4.0/22 cabinet 3 = 10.100.8.0/22 \u0026hellip;  For the Mountain HMN:\nAllocate a /22 from this range per liquid-cooled cabinet. For example, the following cabinets would be given the following IP addresses in the allocated ranges:\n cabinet 1 = 10.104.0.0/22 cabinet 2 = 10.104.4.0/22 cabinet 3 = 10.104.8.0/22 \u0026hellip;  The values in the table could be modified prior to install if there is a need to ensure that there are no conflicts with customer resources, such as LDAP or license servers. If a customer has more than one HPE Cray EX system, these values can be safely reused across them all.\nContact customer support for this site if it is required to change the IP address range for Kubernetes services or pods; for example, if the IP addresses within those ranges must be used for something else. The cluster must be fully reinstalled if either of those ranges are changed.\nCustomizable Network Values There are several network values and other pieces of system information that must be unique to the customer system.\n  IP address values and the network for ncn-m001 and the BMC on ncn-m001.\n  The main Customer Access Network (CAN) subnet and the two address pools mentioned below need to be part of the main subnet.\nFor more information on the CAN, see Customer Access Network.\n Subnet for the MetalLB static address pool (can-static-pool), which is used for services that need to be pinned to the same IP address, such as the system DNS service. Subnet for the MetalLB dynamic address pool (can-dynamic-pool), which is used for services such as User Access Instances (UAIs) that can be reached by DNS.    HPE Cray EX Domain: The value of the subdomain that is used to access externally exposed services.\nFor example, if the system is named TestSystem, and the site is example.com, the HPE Cray EX domain would be testsystem.example.com. Central DNS would need to be configured to delegate requests for addresses in this domain to the HPE Cray EX DNS IP address for resolution.\n  HPE Cray EX DNS IP: The IP address used for the HPE Cray EX DNS service. Central DNS delegates the resolution for addresses in the HPE Cray EX Domain to this server. The IP address will be in the can-static-pool subnet.\n  CAN gateway IP address: The IP address assigned to a specific port on the spine switch, which will act as the gateway between the CAN and the rest of the customer\u0026rsquo;s internal networks. This address would be the last-hop route to the CAN network.\n  "

See Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters.\nBOS   Reconstruct boot session templates for impacted product streams to repopulate data.\nBoot preparation information for other product streams can be found in the following locations:\n UANs: Refer to the UAN product stream repository and search for the \u0026ldquo;PREPARE UAN BOOT SESSION TEMPLATES\u0026rdquo; header in the \u0026ldquo;Install and Configure UANs\u0026rdquo; procedure. Cray Operating System (COS): Refer to the \u0026ldquo;Create a Boot Session Template\u0026rdquo; header in the \u0026ldquo;Boot COS\u0026rdquo; procedure in the COS product stream documentation.    CPS   Repopulate clusters for CPS.\n If there are no clients using CPS when the etcd cluster is rebuilt, then nothing needs to be done other than to rebuild the cluster and make sure all of the components are up and running. See Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters for more information. If any clients have already mounted content provided by CPS, that content should be unmounted before rebuilding the etcd cluster, and then re-mounted after the etcd cluster is rebuilt. Compute nodes that use CPS to access their root file system must be shut down to unmount, and then booted to perform the re-mount.

Postgres replication lag can be detected with Prometheus alerts and alert notifications (See Configure Prometheus Email Alert Notifications). If replication lag is not caught early, it can cause the disk mounted on /home/postgres/pgdata to fill up and the database to stop running. If this issue is caught before the database stops, it can be easily remediated using a patronictl command to reinitialize the lagging cluster member.\nCheck if Replication is Working When services have a Postgres cluster of pods, they need to be able to replicate data between them. When the pods are not able to replicate data, the database will become full. The patronictl list command will show the status of replication:\nThe following is an example where replication is working:\nncn-mw# kubectl exec keycloak-postgres-0 -c postgres -n services -it -- patronictl list Example output:\n+-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | Cluster | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-0 | 10.40.0.23 | Leader | running | 1 | | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-1 | 10.42.0.25 | | running | 1 | 0 | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-2 | 10.42.0.29 | | running | 1 | 0 | +-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ The following is an example where replication is broken:\n+-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ | Cluster | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-0 | 10.42.10.22 | | starting | | unknown | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-1 | 10.40.11.191 | Leader | running | 47 | | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-2 | 10.40.11.190 | | running | 14 | 608 | +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ Recover Replication In the event that a state of broken Postgres replication persists and the space allocated for the WAL files fills up, the affected database will likely shut down and create a state where it can be very difficult to recover. This can impact the reliability of the related service and may require that it be redeployed with data repopulation procedures. If replication lag is caught and remediated before the database shuts down, replication can be recovered using patronictl reinit.\nA reinitialize will get the lagging replica member re-synced and replicating again. This should be done as soon as replication lag is detected. In the preceding example, keycloak-postgres-0 and keycloak-postgres-2 were not replicating properly (Lag\u0026gt;0 or unknown). To remediate, kubectl exec into the leader pod and use patronictl reinit \u0026lt;cluster\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lagging cluster member\u0026gt; to reinitialize the lagging member(s).

See Configure Prometheus Email Alert Notifications.\nIs the Postgres status SyncFailed? Check all the postgresql resources Check for any postgresql resource that has a STATUS of SyncFailed. SyncFailed generally means that there is something between the postgres-operator and the Postgres cluster that is out of sync. This does not always mean that the cluster is unhealthy. To determine the underlying sync issue, check the postgres-operator logs for messages to further root cause the issue.\nOther STATUS values such as Updating are a non-issue.

	"content": "Kubernetes The system management components are broken down into a series of micro-services. Each service is independently deployable, fine-grained, and uses lightweight protocols. As a result, the system\u0026rsquo;s micro-services are modular, resilient, and can be updated independently. Services within this architecture communicate via REST APIs.\nAbout Kubernetes Kubernetes is a portable and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes serves as a micro-services platform on the system that facilitates application deployment, scaling, and management. The system uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.\nResiliency The resiliency feature of Kubernetes ensures that the desired number of deployments of a micro-service are always running on one or more NCNs. In addition, Kubernetes ensures that if one NCN becomes unresponsive, the micro-services that were running on it are migrated to another NCN that is up and meets the requirements of the micro-services.\nKubernetes Components Kubernetes components can be divided into:\n Master components - Kubernetes master components provide the cluster\u0026rsquo;s control plane. These components make global decisions about the cluster, such as scheduling, and responding to cluster events. Worker components - A Kubernetes worker is a node that provides services necessary to run application containers. It is managed by the Kubernetes master. Node components run on every node and keep pods running, while providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.  An etcd cluster is used for storage and state management of the Kubernetes cluster.\n"

	"content": "Kubernetes Networking Every Kubernetes pod has an IP address in the pod network that is reachable within the cluster. The system uses the weave-net plugin for inter-node communication.\nAccess services from outside the cluster All services with a REST API must be accessed from outside the cluster using the Istio Ingress Gateway. This gateway can be accessed using a URL in the following format:\nhttps://api.cmn.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME https://api.can.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME https://api.chn.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME The API requests then get routed to the appropriate node running that service.\nAccess services from within the cluster All services running inside the cluster can access each other using their Pod IP address or the service\u0026rsquo;s cluster IP address, along with the service\u0026rsquo;s exposed port. The exception to this is a service that has a Cray REST API. These services are configured such that they must be accessed through the API gateway service.\nNetwork Policies Kubernetes supports network policies to limit access to pods. Therefore, services running inside the cluster generally cannot access each other using their Pod IP address or the service\u0026rsquo;s cluster IP address. Any other services that must be accessed through a protocol other than REST, can do so using the cluster VIP and the service\u0026rsquo;s NodePort. Only services that are configured to expose a NodePort or ExternalIP can be accessed from outside the cluster.\nAs part of the SMS installation, the following network policies are configured on the system:\n keycloak-database: Allows only keycloak to access the keycloak Postgres instance sma-zookeeper: Allows only Apache Kafka to access the SMA Zookeeper instance sma-postgres: Allows only Grafana to access the SMA Postgres instance hms-mariadb: Allows only SMD to access the MariaDB instance hms-badger: Allows only badger services to access the badger Postgres instance api-gateway-database: Allows only the API gateway to access the API gateway Postgres instance api-gateway-upstream: Allows only the API gateway to access the upstream services vcs-database: Allows only Gitea to access the VCS instance  To learn more about Kubernetes, refer to https://kubernetes.io/.\n"

	"content": "Pod Resource Limits Kubernetes uses resource requests and Quality of Service (QoS) for scheduling pods. Resource requests can be provided explicitly for pods and containers, whereas pod QoS is implicit, based on the resource requests and limits of the containers in the pod. There are three types of QoS:\n Guaranteed: All containers in a pod have explicit memory and CPU resource requests and limits. For each resource, the limit equals the request. Burstable: Does not meet Guaranteed requirements, but some of the containers have explicit memory and CPU resource requests or limits. BestEffort: None of the containers specify any resources.  Kubernetes will best be able to schedule pods when there are resources associated with each container in each pod.\nResource Limits For systems, all containers should have explicit resource requests and limits. Most pods should fall into the Burstable category. Containers that have resource requests equal to the resource limits should be reserved for very well behaved containers, and will usually be simple, single-function containers. One example of this could be an init container that is waiting for another resource to become available.\nResource limits are set by default at the namespace level, but pods within that namespace can increase or decrease their limits depending on the nature of the workload.\n"

The IP address is created automatically via a cronjob that runs at the top of each hour.\n  Determine the periodic backup name for the cluster.\nThe following example is for the bos cluster:\nncn-w001# kubectl get etcdbackup -n services | grep bos.*periodic cray-bos-etcd-cluster-periodic-backup   Delete the etcd backup definition.\nA new backup will be created that points to the new IP address. Use the value returned in the previous substep.\nncn-w001# kubectl delete etcdbackup -n services \\ cray-bos-etcd-cluster-periodic-backup     Rerun the etcd cluster health check (see Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters) after recovering one or more clusters.

	"content": "About etcd The system uses etcd for storing all of its cluster data. It is an open source database that is excellent for maintaining the state of Kubernetes. Failures in the etcd cluster at the heart of Kubernetes will cause a failure of Kubernetes. To mitigate this risk, the system is deployed with etcd on dedicated disks and with a specific configuration to optimize Kubernetes workloads. The system also provides additional etcd cluster(s) as necessary to help maintain an operational state of services. These additional clusters are managed by a Kubernetes operator and do not interact with the core Kubernetes etcd service.\nTo learn more about etcd, refer to the following links:\n General documentation - https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd README - https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/etcdctl etcd upstream performance - https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/benchmarks/  Usage of etcd on the System Communication between etcd machines is handled via the Raft consensus algorithm. Latency from the etcd leader is the most important metric to track because severe latency will introduce instability within the cluster. Raft is only as fast as the slowest machine in the majority. This problem can be mitigated by properly tuning the cluster.\netcd is a highly available key value store that runs on the three non-compute nodes (NCNs) that act as Kubernetes worker nodes. The three node cluster size deployment is used to meet the minimum requirements for resiliency. Scaling to more nodes will provide more resiliency, but it will not provide more speed. For example, one write to the cluster is actually three writes, so one to each instance. Scaling to five or more instances in a cluster would mean that one write will actually equal five writes to the cluster.\nThe system utilizes etcd in two major ways:\n etcd running on bare-metal with a dedicated disk partition  Supports only Kubernetes Includes a dedicated partition to provide the best throughput and scalability  Enables the Kubernetes services to be scaled, as well as the physical nodes running those services Run on the Kubernetes master nodes and will not relocate  Handles replication and instance re-election in the event of a node failure   Backed up to a Ceph Rados Gateway (S3 compatible) bucket     etcd running via a Kubernetes operator  Services utilize this to deploy an etcd cluster on the worker nodes The etcd pods are mobile and will relocate in the event of a pod or node failure Each etcd cluster can be backed up to a Ceph Rados Gateway (S3 compatible) bucket  This option is decided by the service owner or developer as some information has an extremely short lifespan, and by the time the restore could be performed, the data would be invalid      "

On the other hand, Kubernetes taints enable a node to repel a set of pods. In addition, pods can have tolerances for taints to allow them to run on nodes with certain taints.\nTaints are controlled with the kubectl taint nodes command, while node labels for various nodes can be customized with a configmap that contains the desired values. For a description of how to modify the default node labels, refer to the Customer Access Network (CAN) documentation.\nThe list of existing labels can be retrieved using the following command:\nncn# kubectl get nodes --show-labels To learn more, refer to https://kubernetes.io/.\n"

	"content": "Customize an Image Root Using IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment.\nAfterwards, the IMS customization workflow automatically copies the NCN CA public key to /etc/cray/ca/certificate_authority.crt within the image root being customized, in order to enable secure communications between NCNs and client nodes. IMS then compresses the customized image root and uploads it and its associated initrd image and kernel image (needed to boot a node) to the artifact repository.\nPrerequisites  System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployments:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS) cray-nexus, the Nexus repository manager service   kubectl is installed locally and configured to point at the SMS Kubernetes cluster. An IMS registered image root archive or a pre-built image root SquashFS archive is available to customize. The NCN Certificate Authority (CA) public key has been properly installed into the CA cache for this system. A token providing Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials has been generated. When customizing an image using IMS Image Customization, once inside the image root using chroot (if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution.  Limitations  The commands in this procedure must be run as the root user. Currently, the initrd image and kernel image are not regenerated automatically when the image root is changed. The admin must manually regenerate them while in the customization environment, if needed. Images in the .txz compressed format need to be converted to SquashFS in order to use IMS image customization.  Procedure   Check for an existing IMS public key.\n If it is known that a public key associated with the user account being used was not previously uploaded to the IMS service, then skip this step and proceed to upload the SSH public key to the IMS service.\n The following query may return multiple public key records. The correct one will have a name value including the current username in use.\nncn# cray ims public-keys list Example output:\n[...] [[results]] public_key = \u0026quot;ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA ... AsVruw1Zeiec2IWt\u0026quot; id = \u0026quot;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;username public key\u0026quot; created = \u0026quot;2018-11-21T17:19:07.830000+00:00\u0026quot; [...]  If a public key associated with the username in use is not returned, then proceed to upload the SSH public key to the IMS service. Otherwise, if a public key associated with the username does exist, then note the value of its id field and proceed to record the IMS publlic key ID.  \n  Upload the SSH public key to the IMS service.\n If an IMS public key record has already been created for the account being used, then note the value of its id field and proceed to record the IMS publlic key ID.\n The IMS debug/configuration shell relies on passwordless SSH. This SSH public key needs to be uploaded to IMS to enable interaction with the image customization environment later in this procedure.\nReplace the username value with the actual username being used on the system when setting the public key name.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Example output:\npublic_key = \u0026quot;ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCl50gK4l9uupxC2KHxMpTNxPTJbnwEdWy1jst5W5LqJx9fdTrc9uNJ33HAq+WIOhPVGbLm2N4GX1WTUQ4+wVOSmmBBJnlu/l5rmO9lEGT6U8lKG8dA9c7qhguGHy7M7WBgdW/gWA16gwE/u8Qc2fycFERRKmFucL/Er9wA0/Qvz7/U59yO+HOtk5hvEz/AUkvaaoY0IVBfdNBCl59CIdZHxDzgXlXzd9PAlrXZNO8jDD3jyFAOvMMRG7py78zj2NUngvsWYoBcV3FcREZJU529uJ0Au8Vn9DRADyB4QQS2o+fa6hG9i2SzfY8L6vAVvSE7A2ILAsVruw1Zeiec2IWt\u0026quot; id = \u0026quot;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;username public key\u0026quot; created = \u0026quot;2018-11-21T17:19:07.830000+00:00\u0026quot; Note the value of the id field and proceed to record the IMS publlic key ID.\n\n  Record the IMS publlic key ID.\nCreate a variable for the IMS public key id value noted previously.\nncn# export IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID=a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e   Determine if the image root being used is in IMS and ready to be customized.\n If the image to be customized is already known to IMS, then proceed to Locate an IMS Image to Customize. If the image to be customized was created outside of IMS and is not yet known to IMS, then proceed to Import External Image to IMS. To build an image from an existing IMS recipe, proceed to Build an Image Using IMS REST Service.  \n  Locate the IMS image record for the image that is being customized.\nncn# cray ims images list Example output:\n[...] [[results]] created = \u0026quot;2018-12-04T17:25:52.482514+00:00\u0026quot; id = \u0026quot;4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;sles_15_image.squashfs\u0026quot; [results.link] type = \u0026quot;s3\u0026quot; path = \u0026quot;/4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19/sles_15_image.squashfs\u0026quot; etag = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; [...]   Record the IMS image ID.\nCreate a variable for the id field value for the image that is being customized.\nncn# export IMS_IMAGE_ID=4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19   Create an IMS job record in order to start the image customization job.\nAfter customizing the image, IMS will automatically upload any build artifacts (root file system, kernel, and initrd) to S3, and associate the S3 artifacts with IMS. Unfortunately, IMS is not able to dynamically determine the names of the Linux kernel and initrd to look for, because the file name for these vary depending upon Linux distribution, Linux version, dracut configuration, and more. Therefore the user must pass into IMS the name of the kernel and initrd in the resultant image root\u0026rsquo;s /boot directory.\nUse the following table to help determine the default kernel and initrd file names to specify when submitting the job to customize an image. These are just default names. Consult with the site administrator to determine if these names have been changed for a given image or recipe.\n   Recipe Recipe Name Kernel File Name Initrd File Name     SLES 15 SP3 Barebones cray-sles15sp3-barebones vmlinuz initrd   COS cray-shasta-compute-sles15sp3.x86_64-1.4.66 vmlinuz initrd     Under normal circumstances, IMS customization jobs will download and mount the rootfs for the specified IMS image under the /mnt/image/image-root directory within the SSH shell. After SSHing into the job container, cd or chroot into the /mnt/image/image-root directory in order to interact with the image root being customized.\nOptionally, IMS can be told to create a jailed SSH environment by specifying the --ssh-containers-jail True parameter.\nA jailed environment lets users SSH into the SSH container and be immediately within the image root for the image being customized. Users do not need to cd or chroot into the image root. Using a jailed environment has some advantages, such as making the IMS SSH job shell look more like a compute node. This allows applications like the CFS to perform actions on both IMS job pods (pre-boot) and compute nodes (post-boot).\nBefore running the following command, replace the MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE value with the name of the image root being used.\n ncn# cray ims jobs create \\  --job-type customize \\  --kernel-file-name vmlinuz \\  --initrd-file-name initrd \\  --artifact-id $IMS_IMAGE_ID \\  --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\  --enable-debug False \\  --image-root-archive-name MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE Example output:\nstatus = \u0026quot;creating\u0026quot; enable_debug = false kernel_file_name = \u0026quot;vmlinuz\u0026quot; artifact_id = \u0026quot;4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19\u0026quot; build_env_size = 10 job_type = \u0026quot;customize\u0026quot; kubernetes_service = \u0026quot;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service\u0026quot; kubernetes_job = \u0026quot;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-customize\u0026quot; id = \u0026quot;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7\u0026quot; image_root_archive_name = \u0026quot;MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE\u0026quot; initrd_file_name = \u0026quot;initrd\u0026quot; created = \u0026quot;2018-11-21T18:22:53.409405+00:00\u0026quot; kubernetes_namespace = \u0026quot;ims\u0026quot; public_key_id = \u0026quot;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026quot; kubernetes_configmap = \u0026quot;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-configmap\u0026quot; [[ssh_containers]] status = \u0026quot;pending\u0026quot; jail = false name = \u0026quot;customize\u0026quot; [ssh_containers.connection_info.\u0026quot;cluster.local\u0026quot;] host = \u0026quot;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service.ims.svc.cluster.local\u0026quot; port = 22 [ssh_containers.connection_info.customer_access] host = \u0026quot;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7.ims.cmn.shasta.cray.com\u0026quot; port = 22   Create variables for the IMS job ID and Kubernetes job ID.\nThe values for these variables are taken from the output of the command in the previous step. Set IMS_JOB_ID to the value of the id field. Set the IMS_KUBERNETES_JOB to the value of the kubernetes_job field.\nncn# export IMS_JOB_ID=ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7 ncn# export IMS_KUBERNETES_JOB=cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-customize   Create variables for the SSH connection values in the returned data.\nThe IMS customization job enables customization of the image root via an SSH shell accessible by one or more dynamic host names. The user needs to know if they will SSH from inside or outside the Kubernetes cluster to determine which host name to use. Typically, customers access the system from outside the Kubernetes cluster using the Customer Access Network (CAN).\nBefore setting the SSH values, determine the appropriate method to SSH into the customization pod:\n [ssh_containers.connection_info.customer_access] values (preferred): The customer_access address is a dynamic hostname that is made available for use by the customer to access the IMS Job from outside the Kubernetes cluster. [ssh_containers.connection_info.\u0026quot;cluster.local\u0026quot;] values: The cluster.local address is used when trying to access an IMS Job from a pod that is running within the HPE Cray EX Kubernetes cluster.

	"content": "Delete or Recover Deleted IMS Content The Image Management System (IMS) manages user supplied SSH public Keys, customizable image recipes, images, and IMS jobs that are used to build or customize images. In previous versions of IMS, deleting an IMS public key, recipe, or image resulted in that item being permanently deleted. Additionally, IMS recipes and images store linked artifacts in the Simple Storage Service (S3) datastore. These artifacts are referenced by the IMS recipe and image records. The default option when deleting an IMS recipe and image record was to also delete these linked S3 artifacts.\nncn# cray ims recipes list Example output:\n[...] [[results]] id = \u0026quot;76ef564d-47d5-415a-bcef-d6022a416c3c\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;cray-sles15-barebones\u0026quot; created = \u0026quot;2020-02-05T19:24:22.621448+00:00\u0026quot; [results.link] path = \u0026quot;s3://ims/recipes/76ef564d-47d5-415a-bcef-d6022a416c3c/cray-sles15-barebones.tgz\u0026quot; etag = \u0026quot;28f3d78c8cceca2083d7d3090d96bbb7\u0026quot; type = \u0026quot;s3\u0026quot; [...] ncn# cray ims images list Example output:\n[...] [[results]] created = \u0026quot;2018-12-04T17:25:52.482514+00:00\u0026quot; id = \u0026quot;4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;sles_15_image.squashfs\u0026quot; [results.link] type = \u0026quot;s3\u0026quot; path = \u0026quot;/4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19/sles_15_image.squashfs\u0026quot; etag = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; [...] Deleting an IMS image can create a situation where boot artifacts referenced by a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session template no longer exist, making that template unable to boot. Previously, to recover from this situation, an admin would have had to rebuild the boot image using IMS and/or reinstall the prebuilt image from the installer, reapply any Cray and site customizations, and recreate a new BOS template for the IMS image.\nNew functionality has been added to IMS to enable administrators to soft delete, recover (undelete), or hard delete public-keys, recipes, and images. The added functionality provides a way to recover IMS items that were mistakenly deleted. There is no undelete operation for IMS Jobs.\nSoft deleting an IMS record effectively removes the record being deleted from the default collection, and moves it to a new deleted collection. Recovering a deleted IMS record (undelete operation) moves the IMS record from the deleted collection back to the collection of available items. Hard deleting an IMS record permanently deletes it from the deleted collection.\nDelete an IMS Artifact Use the cray CLI utility to delete either soft delete or hard delete an IMS public-key, recipe, or image.\nSoft deleting an IMS public key, recipe, or image removes the record(s) from the collection of available items. Hard deleting permanently removes the item from the deleted collection. Additionally, any linked artifacts are also permanently removed.\nDeleting an IMS public-key, recipe, or image record performs the following actions:\n The IMS record(s) being deleted are moved from the collection of available items to a new deleted collection. Any newly created records within the deleted collection will have the same IMS ID value as it did before being moved there. Any Simple Storage Service (S3) artifacts that are associated with the record or records being deleted are renamed within their S3 buckets so as to make them unavailable under their original key name.

	"content": "Image Management The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from compressed Kiwi image descriptions. These compressed Kiwi image descriptions are referred to as \u0026ldquo;recipes.\u0026rdquo; Kiwi-NG builds images based on a variety of different Linux distributions, specifically SUSE, RHEL, and their derivatives. Kiwi image descriptions must follow the Kiwi development schema. More information about the development schema and the Kiwi-NG tool can be found in the documentation: https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.\nEven though Kiwi recipes can be developed from scratch or found on the Internet, it is recommended that recipes are based on existing HPE Cray image recipes. HPE Cray provides multiple types of recipes including, but not limited to the following:\n Barebones Image Recipes: The barebones recipes contain only the upstream Linux packages needed to successfully boot the image on an HPE Cray compute node using upstream packages. Bare-bones recipes are primarily meant to be used to validate the IMS tools, without requiring HPE Cray Operating System (COS) content. COS Recipes: COS recipes contain a Linux environment with an HPE Cray customized kernel and optimized HPE Cray services for our most demanding customers and workloads.  HPE Cray provided recipes are uploaded to the Simple Storage Service (S3) and registered with IMS as part of the install.\nImages built by IMS contain only the packages and settings that are referenced in the Kiwi-NG recipe used to build the image. The only exception is that IMS will dynamically install the system\u0026rsquo;s root CA certificate to allow zypper (via Kiwi-NG) to talk securely with the required Nexus RPM repositories. Images that are intended to be used to boot a CN or other node must be configured with DNS and other settings that enable the image to talk to vital services. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution, which are typically run against an image after it is built by IMS.\nWhen customizing an image via IMS image customization, once chrooted into the image root (or if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the CFS to enable DNS resolution.\nThe Nexus Repository Manager service provides local RPM repositories for use when building or customizing an image. The Kiwi image descriptions should reference these repositories as needed. In order to include the custom-repo repository in an IMS Kiwi-NG recipe, the repository source path should be modified to the URI for a repository instance hosted by Nexus.\n\u0026lt;repository type=\u0026quot;rpm-md\u0026quot; alias=\u0026quot;custom-repo\u0026quot; imageinclude=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source path=\u0026quot;https://packages.local/repository/REPO_NAME\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/repository\u0026gt; "

	"content": "Image Management Workflows Overview of how to create an image and how to customize and image.\nThe following workflows are intended to be high-level overviews of image management tasks. These workflows depict how services interact with each other during image management and help to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nThe workflows in this section include:\n Create a New Image Customize an Image  Create a New Image Use Case: The system administrator creates an image root from a customized recipe. The new image can be used to boot compute nodes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the Image Management Service (IMS) with other services during the image build process. The process of image creation builds an image from a recipe. An administrator may choose to use the Cray-provided recipes or customize Kiwi recipes to define the image to be built.\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Image Management Service (IMS) allows administrators and users to build or customize (pre-boot) images from kiwi-ng recipes. This service is responsible for enabling the creation of bootable and non-bootable images, enabling image customization via an SSH-able environment, and packaging and association of new/customized image artifacts (kernel, rootfs, initrd, etc) with a new IMS image record. Nexus is needed for image creation and image customization. Nexus provides local RPM repositories for use when building or customizing an image. You can define zypper or Yum package repositories and provide the RPM content for installing and updating software for every compute and non-compute node in the system. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores boot artifacts. Recipes are stored in the ims bucket and images are stored in the boot-images bucket.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occurs during this workflow.\n  Administrator downloads an existing recipe from S3\nTo create a custom recipe, the administrator can first download an existing recipe from S3. A Kiwi recipe consists of multiple files and directories, which together define the repositories, packages and post-install actions to take during the Kiwi build process.\n  Administrator modifies the recipe and uploads to S3\nModify the recipe by editing the files and subdirectories in the image-recipe directory. Edit the config.xml file to modify the name of the recipe, the set of RPM packages being installed or the RPM repositories being referenced. The recipe should be uploaded to S3 in a .tgz archive via CLI.\n  Administrator registers the recipe with IMS\nRegistering the recipe creates a recipe record for your custom recipe in IMS.\nncn# cray ims recipes list   Administrator uploads public key\nA public key is uploaded to allow them to access SSH shells that IMS provides.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   Administrator starts the creation job\nCreate a new IMS image by providing request body parameter, job_type=\u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo;. The following steps 6-10 happen automatically as a part of the image creation process.\nncn# cray ims jobs create \\ --job-type create \\ --image-root-archive-name cray-sles15-barebones \\ --artifact-id $IMS_RECIPE_ID \\ --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\ --enable-debug False   IMS to Ceph S3\nIMS fetches the recipe from S3 and decompresses the recipe to a temporary directory.\n  IMS to Nexus\nIMS waits for repositories to be available from Nexus. The repositories are needed to build the image.\n  IMS creates a custom RPM\nIMS creates a custom RPM to install the CA root certificate from the system into the image. The build-ca-rpm container creates an RPM with the private root-CA certificate for the system and this RPM is installed automatically by Kiwi-NG. The CA root certificate is required to enable secure HTTPS access to the RPM repositories when building the image root.\n  IMS calls Kiwi-NG to build the image\nIMS calls Kiwi-NG to build the image root from the recipe and accesses packages in zypper/yum repositories. The building of the image using kiwi happens in the build-image container. After kiwi is done building the image (either success or fail), the buildenv-sidecar container packages the artifacts, or in the case of failure, enables the debug shell if enable-debug is True. In the buildenv-sidecar container, the image artifacts are packaged and new image artifact records are created for each.\nIf there is a failure and enable-debug is true, a debug SSH shell is established. Admin can inspect image build root. Use commands touch /mnt/image/complete in a non-jailed environment or touch /tmp/complete in a jailed (chroot) environment to exit.\n  Save the new image record in IMS\nThe metadata for the new image artifacts is stored in IMS.\n  Upload the new image artifacts to Ceph S3\nThe new image artifacts are uploaded to Ceph S3.\n  Customize an Image Use Case: The system administrator customizes an existing image and makes desired changes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the Image Management Service (IMS) with Ceph S3 during the image customization process. The customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment. IMS then compresses the customized image root and uploads it and its associated initrd image and kernel image (needed to boot a node) to Ceph S3.\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Image Management Service (IMS) allows administrators and users to build or customize (pre-boot) images from kiwi-ng recipes. This service is responsible for enabling the creation of bootable and non-bootable images, enabling image customization via an SSH-able environment, and packaging and association of new/customized image artifacts (kernel, rootfs, initrd, etc) with a new IMS image record. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores artifacts. Recipes are stored in the ims bucket and images are stored in the boot-images bucket.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occurs during this workflow.\n  The administrator identifies an existing image to be customized.\nRetrieve a list of ImageRecords indicating images that have been registered with IMS. IMS uses the ImageRecord to read the image\u0026rsquo;s manifest.yaml to find the image\u0026rsquo;s root file system (rootfs) artifact. Note the id of the image that you want to customize.\nncn# cray ims images list   The administrator uploads a public key.\nA public key is uploaded to allow them to access SSH shells that IMS provides.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   The administrator starts the image customization job.\nCreate a new IMS image by providing the --job-type customize argument to the cray ims jobs create command. The following steps (4-8) happen automatically as a part of the image customization process.\nncn# cray ims jobs create \\  --job-type customize \\  --image-root-archive-name my_customized_image \\  --kernel-file-name vmlinuz \\  --initrd-file-name initrd \\  --artifact-id $IMS_IMAGE_ID \\  --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\  --enable-debug False   IMS to Ceph S3.\nIMS downloads the image root (rootfs) from Ceph S3 and decompresses the image root to a temporary directory.\n  IMS creates an SSH environment for image customization.\nIMS spins up an sshd container so that the administrator can modify the image. The administrator accesses the sshd container and makes changes to the image. For example, it may be necessary to modify the timezone, or modify the programming environment, etc. Use touch /mnt/image/complete in a non-jailed environment or touch /tmp/complete in a jailed (chroot) environment to exit. The shell can be run in either a jailed or non-jailed mode.\nThe output is a new image. Note that the original image also exists. IMS customizes a copy of the original image.\n  buildenv-sidecar container packages new image artifacts.\nThe buildenv-sidecar container waits for the administrator to exit the SSH session. Upon completion, new records are created for each image artifact. It also adds the root CA certificate to the image and packages the new image artifacts (kernel, initrd, rootfs).\n  Save the new image record in IMS.\nThe metadata for the new image artifacts is stored in IMS.\n  Upload the new image artifacts to Ceph S3.\nThe new image artifacts are uploaded to Ceph S3.\n  "

	"content": "Import an External Image to IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) is typically used to build images from IMS recipes and customize Images that are already known to IMS. However, it is sometimes the case that an image is built using a mechanism other than by IMS and needs to be added to IMS. In these cases, the following procedure can be used to add this external image to IMS and upload the image\u0026rsquo;s artifact(s) to the Simple Storage Service (S3).\nPrerequisites  System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployments:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS)   kubectl is installed locally and configured to point at the SMS Kubernetes cluster.

To learn how these can be used to add specific configuration to the image root, reference the Kiwi-NG documentation. See https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.

IMS is not able to dynamically determine the Linux kernel and initrd to look for because the file name for these vary depending upon Linux distribution, Linux version, dracut configuration, and more. Thus, the user must pass the name of the kernel and initrd that IMS will look for in the resultant image root\u0026rsquo;s /boot directory.\nUse the following table to help determine the default kernel and initrd file names to specify when submitting the job to customize an image.

Images that are intended to be used to boot a CN or other node must be configured with DNS and other settings that enable the image to talk to vital services. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution, which are typically run against an image after it is built by IMS.\nWhen customizing an image via Customize an Image Root Using IMS, once chrooted into the image root (or if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. That base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the CFS to enable DNS resolution.\n"

	"content": "Create UAN Boot Images Update configuration management Git repository to match the installed version of the UAN product. Then use that updated configuration to create UAN boot images and a BOS session template.\nThis is the overall workflow for preparing UAN images for booting UANs:\n Clone the UAN configuration Git repository and create a branch based on the branch imported by the UAN installation. Update the configuration content and push the changes to the newly created branch. Create a Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configuration for the UANs, specifying the Git configuration and the UAN image to apply the configuration to. More Cray products can also be added to the CFS configuration so that the UANs can install multiple Cray products into the UAN image at the same time. Configure the UAN image using CFS and generate a newly configured version of the UAN image. Create a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) boot session template for the UANs. This template maps the configured image, the CFS configuration to be applied post-boot, and the nodes which will receive the image and configuration.  Once the UAN BOS session template is created, the UANs will be ready to be booted by a BOS session.\nReplace PRODUCT_VERSION and CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME in the example commands in this procedure with the current UAN product version installed (See Step 1) and the hostname of the HPE Cray EX system, respectively.\nPrerequisites The UAN product stream must be installed.\nLimitations This guide only details how to apply UAN-specific configuration to the UAN image and nodes. Consult the manuals for the individual HPE products (for example, workload managers and the HPE Cray Programming Environment) that must be configured on the UANs.\nProcedure UAN Image Pre-Boot Configuration   Obtain the artifact IDs and other information from the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap. Record the information labeled in the following example.\nUpon successful installation of the UAN product, the UAN configuration, image recipes, and prebuilt boot images are cataloged in this ConfigMap. This information is required for this procedure.\nncn-m001# kubectl get cm -n services cray-product-catalog -o json | jq -r .data.uan Example output:\nPRODUCT_VERSION: configuration: clone_url: https://vcs.CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git # \u0026lt;--- Gitea clone url commit: 6658ea9e75f5f0f73f78941202664e9631a63726 # \u0026lt;--- Git commit id import_branch: cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION # \u0026lt;--- Git branch with configuration import_date: 2021-02-02 19:14:18.399670 ssh_url: git@vcs.CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME:cray/uan-config-management.git images: cray-shasta-uan-cos-sles15sp1.x86_64-0.1.17: # \u0026lt;--- IMS image name id: c880251d-b275-463f-8279-e6033f61578b # \u0026lt;--- IMS image id recipes: cray-shasta-uan-cos-sles15sp1.x86_64-0.1.17: # \u0026lt;--- IMS recipe name id: cbd5cdf6-eac3-47e6-ace4-aa1aecb1359a # \u0026lt;--- IMS recipe id   Generate the password hash for the root user.

Replace CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME in the clone_url with api-gw-service-nmn.local when cloning the repository.\nThe repository is in the VCS/Gitea service and the location is reported in the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap in the configuration.clone_url key. The CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME from the clone_url is replaced with api-gw-service-nmn.local in the command that clones the repository.\nncn-m001# git clone https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git ncn-m001# cd uan-config-management \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git checkout cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git pull   Create a branch using the imported branch from the installation to customize the UAN image.\nThis imported branch will be reported in the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap in the configuration.import_branch key under the UAN section. The format is cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION. In this guide, an integration branch is used for examples, but the name can be any valid git branch name.\nModifying the cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION branch that was created by the UAN product installation is not allowed by default.\nncn-m001# git checkout -b integration \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git merge cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION   Configure a root user in the UAN image by adding the encrypted password of the root user from /etc/shadow on an NCN worker to the file group_vars/Application/passwd.yml. Skip this step if the root user is already configured in the image.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise recommends configuring a root user in the UAN image for troubleshooting purposes. The entry for root user password will resemble the following example:\nroot_passwd: $6$LmQ/PlWlKixK$VL4ueaZ8YoKOV6yYMA9iH0gCl8F4C/3yC.jMIGfOK6F61h6d.iZ6/QB0NLyex1J7AtOsYvqeycmLj2fQcLjfE1   Apply any site-specific customizations and modifications to the Ansible configuration for the UAN nodes and commit the changes.\nThe default Ansible play to configure UAN nodes is site.yml in the base of the uan-config-management repository. The roles that are executed in this play allow for nondefault configuration as required for the system.\nConsult the individual Ansible role README.md files in the uan-config-management repository roles directory to configure individual role variables. Roles prefixed with uan_ are specific to UAN configuration and include network interfaces, disk, LDAP, software packages, and message of the day roles.\nVariables should be defined and overridden in the Ansible inventory locations of the repository as shown in the following example and not in the Ansible plays and roles defaults. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#content-organization for directory layouts for inventory.\n WARNING: Never place sensitive information such as passwords in the Git repository.\n The following example shows how to add a vars.yml file containing site-specific configuration values to the Application group variable location.\nThese and other Ansible files do not necessarily need to be modified for UAN image creation.\nncn-m001# vim group_vars/Application/vars.yml ncn-m001# git add group_vars/Application/vars.yml ncn-m001# git commit -m \u0026#34;Add vars.yml customizations\u0026#34;   Verify that the System Layout Service (SLS) and the uan_interfaces configuration role refer to the Mountain Node Management Network by the same name.

Add them to the CFS configuration for the UAN, if wanted.\nFor the commit value for the UAN layer, use the Git commit value obtained in the previous step.\nSee the product manuals for further information on configuring other Cray products, as this procedure documents only the configuration of the UAN. More layers can be added to be configured in a single CFS session.\nThe following configuration example can be used for preboot image customization as well as post-boot node configuration.\n{ \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uan-integration-PRODUCT\\_VERSION\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cloneUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;playbook\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;site.yml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ecece54b1eb65d484444c4a5ca0b244b329f4667\u0026#34; } # **{ ... add configuration layers for other products here, if desired ... }** ] }   Add the configuration to CFS using the JSON input file.\nIn the following example, the JSON file created in the previous step is named uan-config-PRODUCT_VERSION.json only the details for the UAN layer are shown.\nncn-m001# cray cfs configurations update uan-config-PRODUCT_VERSION \\  --file ./uan-config-PRODUCT_VERSION.json \\  --format json Example output:\n{ \u0026quot;lastUpdated\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2021-07-28T03:26:00:37Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;layers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;cloneUrl\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;commit\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ecece54b1eb65d484444c4a5ca0b244b329f4667\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;uan-integration-PRODUCT_VERSION\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;playbook\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;site.yml\u0026quot; } # \u0026lt;-- Additional layers not shown, but would be inserted here ], \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;uan-config-PRODUCT_VERSION\u0026quot; }   Modify the UAN image to include the 1.4.0 day zero RPMs.\n  Untar the 1.4.0 Day Zero Patch tarball if it is not untarred already.\nncn-m001# tar -xvf shasta-1.4.0-p2.tar Example output:\n1.4.0-p2/ 1.4.0-p2/csm/ 1.4.0-p2/csm/csm-0.8.22-0.9.0.patch.gz 1.4.0-p2/csm/csm-0.8.22-0.9.0.patch.gz.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/uan/ 1.4.0-p2/uan/uan-2.0.0-uan-2.0.0.patch.gz 1.4.0-p2/uan/uan-2.0.0-uan-2.0.0.patch.gz.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/ 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-compute-2.12_4.0.102-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-devel-2.12_4.0.102-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-kmp-cray_shasta_c-2.12_4.0.102_k4.12.14_197.78_9.1.58-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-network-config-1.1.7-20210318094806_b409053-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/slingshot-network-config-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/slingshot-network-config-full-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-compute-2.12_4.0.102-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-devel-2.12_4.0.102-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-dvs-kmp-cray_shasta_c-2.12_4.0.102_k4.12.14_197.78_9.1.58-7.0.1.0_8.1__g30d29e7a.x86_64.rpm.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/cray-network-config-1.1.7-20210318094806_b409053-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/slingshot-network-config-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm.md5sum 1.4.0-p2/rpms/slingshot-network-config-full-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm.md5sum   Download the rootfs image specified in the UAN product catalog.\nReplace IMAGE_ID in the following export command with the IMS image ID recorded in Step 1.\nncn-m001# export UAN_IMAGE_ID=IMAGE_ID ncn-m001# cray artifacts get boot-images ${UAN_IMAGE_ID}/rootfs \\ ${UAN_IMAGE_ID}.squashfs ncn-m001# la ${UAN_IMAGE_ID}.squashfs -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.5G Mar 17 19:35 f3ba09d7-e3c2-4b80-9d86-0ee2c48c2214.squashfs   Mount the squashfs file and copy its contents to a different directory.\nncn-m001# mkdir mnt ncn-m001# mkdir UAN-1.4.0-day-zero ncn-m001# mount -t squashfs ${UAN_IMAGE_ID}.squashfs mnt -o ro,loop ncn-m001# cp -a mnt UAN-1.4.0-day-zero ncn-m001# umount mnt ncn-m001# rmdir mnt   Copy the new RPMs into the new image directory.\nncn-m001# cp 1.4.0-p2/rpms/* UAN-1.4.0-day-zero/ ncn-m001# cd UAN-1.4.0-day-zero/   Chroot into the new image directory.\nncn-m001# chroot . bash   Update, erase, and install RPMs in the new image directory.\nchroot-ncn-m001# rpm -Uv cray-dvs-*.rpm chroot-ncn-m001# rpm -e cray-network-config chroot-ncn-m001# rpm -e slingshot-network-config-full chroot-ncn-m001# rpm -e slingshot-network-config chroot-ncn-m001# rpm -iv slingshot-network-config-full-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm \\ slingshot-network-config-1.1.7-20210318093253_83fab52-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm \\ cray-network-config-1.1.7-20210318094806_b409053-sles15sp1.x86_64.rpm   Generate a new initrd to match the updated image by running the /tmp/images.sh script.

	"content": "HPE PDU Admin Procedures The following procedures are used to manage the HPE Power Distribution Unit (PDU):\n Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface HPE PDU Initial Set-up Update HPE PDU Firmware Change HPE PDU User Passwords Discover HPE PDU after Upgrading CSM   IMPORTANT: Because of the polling method used to process sensor data from the HPE PDU, telemetry data may take up to six minutes to refresh; this includes the outlet status reported by the Hardware State Manager (HSM).\n Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface Connect and log in to the HPE PDU web interface. Access to the HPE PDU web interface is required for the other administrative procedures in this section.\nPrerequisites The following is needed before running this procedure:\n IP address or Domain Name of ncn-m001 Component name (xname) of the HPE PDU Root password for ncn-m001 Admin password for HPE PDU (default: 12345678)  Procedure   Use the ssh command from a local PC/MAC/Linux machine:\n\u0026gt; ssh -L 8443:{PDU_xname}:443 -N root@{ncn-m001_ip} In this example, {PDU_xname} is the component name (xname) of the PDU and {ncn-m001_ip} is the IP address of ncn-m001.\nEnter the root password for ncn-m001 when prompted.\n  Connect to https://localhost:8443 using a web browser.\n  Log in with the admin username. Enter the admin password. If the admin password has not been changed, there will be a prompt to change the password.\n  HPE PDU Initial Set-up Set up an HPE PDU for administrative use by completing the following tasks:\n Ensure Redfish is enabled Add the default user Enable Outlet Control  Procedure  Connect to the HPE PDU Web Interface (See Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface) and log in as admin.  Ensure Redfish is Enabled  Use the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; icon (gear in computer monitor in top right corner) to navigate to \u0026ldquo;Network Settings\u0026rdquo;. Verify there is a check next to \u0026ldquo;RESTapi Access\u0026rdquo;, if not, click the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; icon (pencil) and enable.  Add Default User  Use the \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; menu (top right corner) to navigate to \u0026ldquo;User Accounts\u0026rdquo;. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Add User\u0026rdquo; button. Use the form to add the username and password for the default River user. Assign the role \u0026ldquo;Administrator\u0026rdquo; to that user.  Enable Outlet Control  Using the \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; icon (House in top right corner) navigate to \u0026ldquo;Control \u0026amp; Manage\u0026rdquo;. Verify \u0026ldquo;Outlet Control Enable\u0026rdquo; switch on the top of the page is selected (green).  Update HPE PDU Firmware Verify that the firmware version for the HPE PDU is 2.0.0.L. If it is not, a firmware update is required.\nProcedure Check Firmware Version  Connect to the HPE PDU Web Interface (See Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface) and log in as admin. Check which version of firmware is installed by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; icon (House in the top right corner) and navigating to \u0026ldquo;Identification\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;Version\u0026rdquo; will be displayed. If the version is not the \u0026ldquo;2.0.0.L\u0026rdquo;, update firmware.  Update Firmware  Download version 2.0.0.L firmware from: https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/search?language=en_US#q=P9S23A\u0026amp;t=All\u0026amp;sort=%40hpescuniversaldate%20descending\u0026amp;numberOfResults=25\u0026amp;f:@contenttype=[Drivers%20and%20Software] This will download an .exe file, which is a self extracting zip file. If using a Windows system, run the .exe file to extract the files, or use an unzip program on the file. One of the files extracted will be named \u0026ldquo;HPE.FW\u0026rdquo;, that is the firmware file needed for uploading. Connect to the HPE PDU Web Interface (See Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface) and log in as admin. Use the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; icon (gear in computer monitor in top right corner) to navigate to \u0026ldquo;System Management\u0026rdquo;. Click the \u0026ldquo;Update Firmware\u0026rdquo; button. Click \u0026ldquo;Choose File\u0026rdquo; and select the \u0026ldquo;HPE.FW\u0026rdquo; file downloaded. Click \u0026ldquo;Upload\u0026rdquo; button.  The firmware will be updated and the PDU management processor will restart.\nChange HPE PDU User Passwords Change the password of any existing user account using the HPE PDU web interface.\nProcedure  Connect to the HPE PDU Web Interface (See Connect to HPE PDU Web Interface) and log in as admin. Use the \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; menu (top right corner) to navigate to \u0026ldquo;User Accounts\u0026rdquo;. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; icon (pencil) next to the user. Enter new password and make any other changes for that user account and click the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button.  Discover HPE PDU after Upgrading CSM Use the following procedure to ensure the hms-discovery job and Redfish Translation Service (RTS) correctly discover HPE PDUs when upgrading from CSM 1.0 or earlier releases to CSM 1.2.\n IMPORTANT: This procedure is only needed when upgrading CSM, not performing a fresh install. This procedure should be run after CSM has been fully upgraded including the discovery job.\n Procedure   In CSM 1.0 and earlier releases, the hms-discovery job and RTS treated all PDUs as if were made by ServerTech. After the upgrade to CSM 1.2, RTS will still think the HPE PDUs in the system are ServerTech PDUs. Remove these erroneous HPE PDU entries for RTS from Vault.\n  Get Vault password and create Vault alias.\nncn# VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.data[\u0026#34;vault-root\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; | base64 -d) ncn# alias vault=\u0026#39;kubectl -n vault exec -i cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_PASSWD VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_FORMAT=json vault\u0026#39;   Identify HPE PDUs known by RTS:\nncn# vault kv list secret/pdu-creds Example output:\n[ \u0026#34;global/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000m0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000m1\u0026#34; ]   Remove each HPE PDU identified in the previous sub-step from Vault:\nncn# PDU=x3000m0 ncn# vault kv delete secret/pdu-creds/$PDU   Restart the Redfish Translation Service (RTS):\nncn# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-hms-rts ncn# kubectl -n services rollout status deployment cray-hms-rts     Find the list of PDU MAC address. The ID field in each element is the normalized MAC address of each PDU:\nncn# cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --type CabinetPDUController   Use the returned ID from the previous step to delete each HPE PDU MAC address from HSM:\nncn# cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete {ID} On the next hms-discovery job run, it should relocate the deleted PDUs and discover it correctly as an HPE PDU.\n  After waiting five minutes, verify the Ethernet interfaces that were previously deleted are now present:\nncn# cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --type CabinetPDUController   Verify the Redfish endpoints for the PDUs exist and are DiscoverOK:\nncn# cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints list --type CabinetPDUController   "

	"content": "Hardware Management Services (HMS) Locking API The locking feature is a part of the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. The locking API enables administrators to lock components on the system. Locking components ensures other system actors, such as administrators or running services, cannot perform a firmware update with the Firmware Action Service (FAS) or a power state change with the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC). Locks only constrain FAS and CAPMC from each other and help ensure that a firmware update action will not be interfered with by a request to power off the device through CAPMC. Locks only work with HMS services and will not impact other system services.\nLocks can only be used to prevent actions firmware updates with FAS or power state changes with CAPMC. Administrators can still use HMS APIs to view the state of various hardware components on the system, even if a lock is in place. There is no automatic locking for hardware devices. Locks need to be manually set or unset by an admin. A scenario that might be encountered is when a larger hardware state change job is run, and one of the components in the job has a lock on it. If FAS is the service running the job, FAS will attempt to update the firmware on each component, and will update all devices that do not have a lock on it. The job will not complete until the node lock ends, or if a timeout is set for the job.\nThe locking API also includes actions to repair or disable a node\u0026rsquo;s locking ability with respect to HMS services. The disable function will make it so a device cannot be firmware updated or power controlled (via an HMS service) until a repair is done. Future requests to perform a firmware update via FAS or power state change via CAPMC cannot be made on that component until the repair action is used.\nWARNING: System administrators should LOCK NCNs after the system has been brought up to prevent an admin from unintentionally firmware updating or powering off an NCN. If this lock is not engaged, an authorized request to FAS or CAPMC could power off the NCNs, which will negatively impact system stability and the health of services running on those NCNs.\n"

	"content": "Hardware State Manager (HSM) State and Flag Fields HSM manages important information for hardware components in the system. Administrators can use the data returned by HSM to learn about the state of the system. To do so, it is critical that the State and Flag fields are understood, and the next steps to take are known when viewing output returned by HSM commands. It is also beneficial to understand what services can cause State or Flag changes in HSM.\nThe following describes what causes State and Flag changes for all HSM components:\n Initial State/Flag is set upon discovery. This is generally Off/OK or On/OK. BMCs go to Ready/OK instead of On/OK. A component in the Populated state after discovery has an unknown power state. If one is expected for nodes, BMCs, or another component, this is likely due to a firmware issue. Flags can be set to Warning or Alert if the component\u0026rsquo;s Status.Health reads as Warning or Critical via Redfish during discovery. State for all components associated with a BMC is set to Empty if that BMC is removed from the network. State change events from components are consumed by HSM via subscriptions to Redfish events. These are subscribed to and placed on the Kafka bus by hmcollector for HSM\u0026rsquo;s consumption. HSM will update component state based on the information in the Redfish events.  The following describes what causes State and Flag changes for nodes only:\n Heartbeat Tracking Daemon (HBTD) updates the state of nodes based on heartbeats it receives from nodes. HBTD sets the node to Ready/OK when it starts heartbeats. HBTD sets the node to Ready/Warning after a few missed heartbeats. HBTD sets the node to Standby after many missed heartbeats and the node is presumed dead.  State descriptions:\n  Empty\nThe location is not populated with a component.\n  Populated\nPresent (not empty), but no further track can or is being done.\n  Off\nPresent but powered off.\n  On\nPowered on. If no heartbeat mechanism is available, its software state may be unknown.\n  Standby\nNo longer Ready and presumed dead. It typically means the heartbeat has been lost (w/ alert).\n  Ready\nBoth On and Ready to provide its expected services. For example, used for jobs.\n  Flag descriptions:\n  OK\nComponent is OK.\n  Warning\nThere is a non-critical error. Generally coupled with a Ready state.\n  Alert\nThere is a critical error. Generally coupled with a Standby state. Otherwise, reported via Redfish.\n  Hardware State Transitions The following table describes how to interpret when the state of hardware changes:\n   Prior State New State Reason     Ready Standby HBTD if node has many missed heartbeats   Ready Ready/Warning HBTD if node has a few missed heartbeats   Standby Ready HBTD node re-starts heartbeating   On Ready HBTD node started heartbeating   Off Ready HBTD sees heartbeats before Redfish Event (On)   Standby On Redfish Event (On) or if re-discovered while in the standby state   Off On Redfish Event (On)   Standby Off Redfish Event (Off)   Ready Off Redfish Event (Off)   On Off Redfish Event (Off)   Any State Empty Redfish Endpoint is disabled meaning component removal    Generally, nodes transition from Off to On to Ready when going from Off to booted, and from Ready to Ready/Warning to Standby to Off when shut down.\n"

	"content": "Manage HMS Locks This section describes how to check the status of a lock, disable reservations, and repair reservations. The disable and repair operations only affect the ability to make reservations on hardware devices.\nSome of the common scenarios an admin might encounter when working with the Hardware State Manager (HSM) Locking API are also described.\nCheck Lock Status Use the following command to verify if a component name (xname) is locked or not. The command will show if it is locked (admin), reserved (service command), or reservation disabled (either an EPO or an admin command).\nThe following shows how to interpret the output:\n Locked: Shows if the component name (xname) has been locked with the cray hsm locks lock create command. Reserved: Shows if the component name (xname) has been locked for a time-boxed event. Only service can reserve component names (xnames); administrators are not able to reserve component names (xnames). ReservationDisable: Shows if the ability to reserve a component name (xname) has been changed by an EPO or admin command.  ncn-m001# cray hsm locks status create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 Example output:\nNotFound = [] [[Components]] ID = \u0026quot;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026quot; Locked = false Reserved = false ReservationDisabled = false Disable Reservations Disabling a lock prevents a service from being able to make a reservation on it, and it releases/ends any current reservations. Even though SMD removes the reservation when disabling a lock, it does not mean that the Firmware Action Service (FAS) is aware that it has lost the reservation. Additionally, if CAPMC has a reservation that is cancelled, disabled, or broken, it will do nothing to the existing CAPMC operation. There are no checks by CAPMC to make sure things are still reserved at any time during a power operation.\nThis is a way to stop new operations from happening, not a way to prevent currently executing operations.\nncn-m001# cray hsm locks disable create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026quot;,] The following is an example of a when a lock is disabled:\nncn-m001# cray hsm locks status create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 Example output:\nNotFound = [] [[Components]] ID = \u0026quot;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026quot; Locked = false Reserved = false ReservationDisabled = true Repair Reservations Locks must be manually repaired after disabling a component or performing a manual EPO.

	"content": "Component Groups and Partitions The Hardware State Manager (HSM) provides the group and partition services. Both are means of grouping (also known as labeling) system components that are tracked by HSM. Components include the nodes, blades, controllers, and more on a system.\nThere is no limit to the number of members a group or partition contains. The only limitation is that all members must be actual members of the system. The HSM needs to know that the components exist.\nGroups Groups are collections of components (primarily nodes) in /hsm/v2/State/Components. Components can be members of any number of groups. Groups can be created freely, and HSM does not assign them any predetermined meaning.\nIf a group has exclusiveGroup=EXCLUSIVE_LABEL_NAME set, then a component may only be a member of one group that matches that exclusive label. For example, if the exclusive group label colors is associated with groups blue, red, and green, then a node that is part of the green group could not also be placed in the red group.\nPartitions Partitions are isolated, non-overlapping groups. Each component can be a member of only one partition at a time, and partitions are used as an access control mechanism. Partitions have a specific predefined meaning, intended to provide logical divisions of a single physical system.\n"

Research Lock and Unlock Management Nodes for more information. Failure to lock the NCNs could result in unintentional update of the NCNs if FAS is not used correctly; this will lead to system instability problems.\n Ignore Nodes within FAS The default configuration of FAS no longer ignores management nodes, which prevents FAS from firmware updating the NCNs. To reconfigure the FAS deployment to exclude non-compute nodes (NCNs) and ensure they cannot have their firmware upgraded, the NODE_BLACKLIST value must be manually enabled\nPreferred Method: Nodes can also be locked with the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API.

It is strongly recommended to run a dry-run (overrideDryrun=false) first and check the actions output.\n Check for New Firmware Versions with a Dry-Run Use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) dry-run feature to determine what firmware can be updated on the system. Dry-runs are enabled by default, and can be configured with the overrideDryrun parameter. A dry-run will create a query according to the filters requested by the admin. It will initiate an update sequence to determine what firmware is available, but will not actually change the state of the firmware.\nWARNING: It is crucial that an admin is familiar with the release notes of any firmware. The release notes will indicate what new features the firmware provides and if there are any incompatibilities. FAS does not know about incompatibilities or dependencies between versions. The admin assumes full responsibility for this knowledge.\nIt is likely that when performing a firmware update, that the current version of firmware will not be available. This means that after successfully upgrading, the firmware cannot be downgraded.\nThis procedure includes information on how check the firmware versions for the entire system, as well as how to target specific manufacturers, component names (xnames), and targets.\nProcedure   Run a dry-run firmware update.\nThe following command parameters should be included in dry-run JSON files:\n overrideDryrun: The overrideDryrun parameter is set to false by default. FAS will only update the system if this is parameter is set to true. restoreNotPossibleOverride: FAS will not perform an update if the currently running firmware is not available in the images repository. Set to true to allow FAS to update firmware, even if the current firmware is unavailable on the system. description: A brief description that helps administrators distinguish between actions. version: Determine if the firmware should be set to the latest, the earliest semantic version, or set to a specific firmware version.

	"content": "FAS CLI This section describes the basic capabilities of the Firmware Action Service (FAS) CLI commands. These commands can be used to manage firmware for system hardware supported by FAS. Refer to the prerequisites section before proceeding to any of the sections for the supported operations.\nThe following CLI operations are described:\n Action  Execute an Action Abort an Action Describe an Action   Snapshots  Create a Snapshot View a Snapshot List Snapshots   Update an Image FAS Loader Commands  Prerequisites The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system.\nExecute an Action Use FAS to execute an action. An action produces a set of firmware operations. Each operation represents a component name (xname) + target on that component name (xname) that will be targeted for update. There are two of firmware action modes: : dryrun or liveupdate; the parameters used when creating either are completely identical except for the overrideDryrun setting. overrideDryrun will determine if feature to determine what firmware can be updated on the system. Dry-runs are enabled by default, and can be configured with the overrideDryrun parameter. A dry-run will create a query according to the filters requested by the admin. It will initiate an update sequence to determine what firmware is available, but will not actually change the state of the firmware\nWARNING: It is crucial that an admin is familiar with the release notes of any firmware. The release notes will indicate what new features the firmware provides and if there are any incompatibilities. FAS does not know about incompatibilities or dependencies between versions. The admin assumes full responsibility for this knowledge. It is also likely that when performing a firmware update, the current version of firmware will not be available. This means that after successfully upgrading, the firmware cannot be reverted or downgraded to a previous version.\nProcedure This will cover the generic process for executing an action. For more specific examples and detailed explanations of options see the Recipes and Filters sections.\n Identify the selection of filters to apply.  Filters narrow the scope of FAS to target specific component names (xnames), manufacturers, targets, and so on. For this example, FAS will run with no selection filters applied.\n Create a JSON file {whole-system-dryrun.json}; to make this a live update set \u0026quot;overrideDryrun\u0026quot;: true.\n{ \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;overrideDryrun\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;restoreNotPossibleOverride\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;timeLimit\u0026#34;: 1000, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dryrun of full system\u0026#34; } }   Execute the dry-run.\nncn# cray fas actions create {whole-system-dryrun.json} ... { \u0026#34;actionID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;e0cdd7c2-32b1-4a25-9b2a-8e74217eafa7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;overrideDryun\u0026#34;: false }   Note the returned actionID.\nSee Interpreting Output for more information.\nAbort an Action Firmware updates can be stopped if required. This is useful given only one action can be run at a time. This is to protect hardware from multiple actions trying to modify it at the same time.\nIMPORTANT: If a Redfish update is already in progress, the abort will not stop that process on the device. It is likely the device will update. If the device needs to be manually power cycled (needManualReboot), it is possible that the device will update, but not actually apply the update until its next reboot. Administrators must verify the state of the system after an abort. Only perform an abort if truly necessary. The best way to check the state of the system is to do a snapshot or do a dry-run of an update.\nProcedure   Issue the abort command to the action.\nncn# cray fas actions instance delete {actionID}   The action could take up to a minute to fully abort.\nDescribe an Action There are several ways to get more information about a firmware update. An actionID and operationIDs are generated when a live update or dry-run is created. These values can be used to learn more about what is happening on the system during an update.\nInterpreting Output For the steps below, the following returned messages will help determine if a firmware update is needed. The following are end states for operations. The Firmware action itself should be in completed once all operations have finished.\n NoOp: Nothing to do, already at version. NoSol: No image is available. succeeded:  IF dryrun: The operation should succeed if performed as a live update. succeeded means that FAS identified that it COULD update a component name (xname) + target with the declared strategy. IF live update: the operation succeeded, and has updated the component name (xname) + target to the identified version.   failed:  IF dryrun : There is something that FAS could do, but it likely would fail; most likely because the file is missing. IF live update : the operation failed, the identified version could not be put on the component name (xname) + target.    Data can be viewed at several levels of information:\nProcedure Get High Level Summary To view counts of operations, what state they are in, the overall state of the action, and what parameters were used to create the action:\nncn# cray fas actions status list {actionID} actionID = \u0026quot;e6dc14cd-5e12-4d36-a97b-0dd372b0930f\u0026quot; snapshotID = \u0026quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\u0026quot; startTime = \u0026quot;2021-09-07 16:43:04.294233199 +0000 UTC\u0026quot; endTime = \u0026quot;2021-09-07 16:53:09.363233482 +0000 UTC\u0026quot; state = \u0026quot;completed\u0026quot; blockedBy = [] [command] overrideDryrun = false restoreNotPossibleOverride = true overwriteSameImage = false timeLimit = 2000 version = \u0026quot;latest\u0026quot; tag = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; description = \u0026quot;Dryrun upgrade of Gigabyte node BMCs\u0026quot; [operationCounts] total = 14 initial = 0 configured = 0 blocked = 0 needsVerified = 0 verifying = 0 inProgress = 0 failed = 0 succeeded = 8 noOperation = 6 noSolution = 0 aborted = 0 unknown = 0 IMPORTANT: Unless the action\u0026rsquo;s state is completed or aborted; then this action is still in progress.\nGet Details of Action  ncn# cray fas actions describe {actionID} --format json { \u0026quot;parameters\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;stateComponentFilter\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;deviceTypes\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;nodeBMC\u0026quot; ] }, \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;dryrun\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;upgrade of nodeBMCs for cray\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;restoreNotPossibleOverride\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;timeLimit\u0026quot;: 1000, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;latest\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;inventoryHardwareFilter\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;manufacturer\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cray\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;imageFilter\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;imageID\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;targetFilter\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;targets\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;BMC\u0026quot; ] } }, \u0026quot;blockedBy\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;completed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;dryrun\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;upgrade of nodeBMCs for cray\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;restoreNotPossibleOverride\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;timeLimit\u0026quot;: 1000, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;latest\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;actionID\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;e0cdd7c2-32b1-4a25-9b2a-8e74217eafa7\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;startTime\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-06-26 20:03:37.316932354 +0000 UTC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;snapshotID\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;endTime\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-06-26 20:04:07.118243184 +0000 UTC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;operationSummary\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;succeeded\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [] }, \u0026quot;verifying\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [] }, \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [] }, \u0026quot;configured\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [] }, \u0026quot;initial\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [] }, \u0026quot;failed\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;OperationsKeys\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;stateHelper\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;unexpected change detected in firmware version.

	"content": "FAS Filters FAS uses five primary filters for actions and snapshots to determine what operations to create. The filters are listed below:\n Selection Filters - Determine what operations will be created. The following selection filters are available:  stateComponentFilter targetFilter inventoryHardwareFilter  imageFilter   Command Filters - Determine how the operations will be executed. The following command filters are available:  command    All filters are logically connected with AND logic. Only the stateComponentFilter, targetFilter, and inventoryHardwareFilter are used for snapshots.\n Selection Filters stateComponentFilter The state component filter allows users to select hardware to update. Hardware can be selected individually with component names (xnames), or in groups by leveraging the Hardware State Manager (HSM) groups and partitions features.\nParameters  xnames - A list of component names (xnames) to target. partitions - A partition to target. groups- A group to target. deviceTypes Set to NodeBMC, RouterBMC, or ChassisBMC. These are the ONLY three allowed types and come from the Hardware State Manager (HSM).   inventoryHardwareFilter The inventory hardware filter takes place after the state component filter has been applied. It will remove any devices that do not conform to the identified manufacturer or models determined by querying the Redfish endpoint.\nIMPORTANT: There can be a mismatch of hardware models. The model field is human-readable and is human-programmable. In some cases, there can be typos where the wrong model is programmed, which causes issues filtering. If this occurs, query the hardware, find the model name, and add it to the images repository on the desired image.\nParameters  manufacturer - Set to Cray, HPE, or Gigabyte. model - The Redfish reported model, which can be specified.   imageFilter FAS applies images to component name (xname)/targets. The image filter is a way to specify an explicit image that should be used. When included with other filters, the image filter reduces the devices considered to only those devices where the image can be applied.\nFor example, if a user specifies an image that only applies to gigabyte, nodeBMCs, BIOS targets. If all hardware in the system is targeted with an empty stateComponentFilter, FAS would find all devices in the system that can be updated via Redfish, and then the image filter would remove all component name (xname)/ targets that this image could not be applied. In this example, FAS would remove any device that is not a Gigabyte nodeBMC, as well as any target that is not BIOS.\nParameters  imageID - The ID of the image to force onto the system. overrideImage - If this is combined with imageID; it will FORCE the selected image onto all hardware identified, even if it is not applicable. WARNING: This may cause undesirable outcomes, but most hardware will prevent a bad image from being loaded.   targetFilter The target filter selects targets that match against the list. For example, if the user specifies only the BIOS target, FAS will include only operations that explicitly have BIOS as a target. A Redfish device has potentially many targets (members). Targets for FAS are case sensitive and must match Redfish.\nParameters  targets - The actual \u0026lsquo;members\u0026rsquo; that will be upgraded. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:  BIOS BMC NIC Node0.BIOS Node1.BIOS Recovery     Command Filters command The command group is the most important part of an action command and controls if the action is executed as dry-run or a live update.\nIt also determines whether or not to override an operation that would normally not be executed if there is no way to return the component name (xname)/target to the previous firmware version. This happens if an image does not exist in the image repository.\nThese filters are then applied; and then command parameter applies settings for the overall action. The swagger file is a great reference.\nParameters  version - Usually latest because that is the most common use case. tag - Usually default because the default image is the most useful one to use. This parameter can usually be ignored. overrideDryrun - This determines if this is a LIVE UPDATE or a DRY-RUN. If doing an override; then it will provide a live update. restoreNotPossibleOverride - This determines if an update (live or dry-run) will be attempted if a restore cannot be performed. Typically there is not enough firmware to be able to do a rollback, which means if the system is an UPDATE away from a particular version, it cannot go back to a previous version. It is most likely that this value will ALWAYS need to be set true. overwriteSameImage - This will cause a firmware update to be performed EVEN if the device is already at the identified, selected version. timeLimit - This is the amount of time in seconds that any operation should be allowed to execute. Most cray hardware can be completed in approximately 1000 seconds or less; but the gigabyte hardware will commonly take 1500 seconds or greater. Setting the value to 4000 is recommended as a stop gap to prevent the operation from never ending, should something get stuck. description- A human-friendly description that should be set to give useful information about the firmware operation.

The targets can be run in the same action (as shown in the example) or run separately by only including one target in the action. On larger systems, it is recommended to run as two actions one after each other as the output will be shorter.\nPrerequisites  The Cray nodeBMC device needs to be updated before the nodeBIOS because the nodeBMC adds a new Redfish field (softwareId) that the NodeX.BIOS update will require. See Update Liquid-Cooled Node Firmware for more information. Compute node BIOS updates require the nodes to be off. If nodes are not off when the update command is issued, it will report as a failed update.  IMPORTANT: The Nodes themselves must be powered off in order to update the BIOS on the nodes. The BMC will still have power and will perform the update.\nIMPORTANT: When the BMC is updated or rebooted after updating the Node0.BIOS and/or Node1.BIOS liquid-cooled nodes, the node BIOS version will not report the new version string until the nodes are powered back on. It is recommended that the Node0/1 BIOS be updated in a separate action, either before or after a BMC update.

Compute Node BIOS Workaround for HPE CRAY EX425 Correct an issue where the model of the liquid-cooled compute node BIOS is the incorrect name. The name has changed from WNC-ROME to HPE CRAY EX425 or HPE CRAY EX425 (ROME).\nPrerequisites  The system is running HPE Cray EX release v1.4 or higher. The system has completed the Cray System Management (CSM) installation. A firmware upgrade has been done following Update Liquid-Cooled Compute Node BIOS Firmware.  The result of the upgrade is that the NodeX.BIOS has failed as noSolution and the stateHelper field for the operation states is \u0026quot;No Image Available\u0026quot;. The BIOS in question is running a version less than or equal to 1.2.5 as reported by Redfish or described by the noSolution operation in FAS.   The hardware model reported by Redfish is wnc-rome, which is now designated as HPE CRAY EX425.  If the Redfish model is different (ignoring casing) and the blades in question are not Windom, contact customer support.

	"content": "Update Firmware with FAS The Firmware Action Service (FAS) provides an interface for managing firmware versions of Redfish-enabled hardware in the system. FAS interacts with the Hardware State Managers (HSM), device data, and image data in order to update firmware.\nReset Gigabyte node BMC to factory defaults if having problems with ipmitool, using Redfish, or when flashing procedures fail. See Set Gigabyte Node BMC to Factory Defaults.\nFAS images contain the following information that is needed for a hardware device to update firmware versions:\n Hardware-specific information: Contains the allowed device states and how to reboot a device if necessary. Selection criteria: How to link a firmware image to a specific hardware type. Image data: Where the firmware image resides in Simple Storage Service (S3) and what firmwareVersion it will report after it is successfully applied. See Artifact Management for more information.  Topics  Prerequisites Warning Current Capabilities Order Of Operations Hardware Precedence Order FAS Admin Procedures Firmware Actions Firmware Operations Firmware Images  Prerequisites  CSM software has been installed, firmware has been loaded into FAS as part of the HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) install, HSM is running, and nodes have been discovered. All management nodes have been locked. Identify the type and manufacturers of hardware in the system. If Gigabyte nodes are not in use on the system, do not update them!  Warning WARNING: Non-compute nodes (NCNs) and their BMCs should be locked with the HSM locking API to ensure they are not unintentionally updated by FAS. See Lock and Unlock Management Nodes for more information. Failure to lock the NCNs could result in unintentional update of the NCNs if FAS is not used correctly; this will lead to system instability problems.\nFollow the process outlined in FAS CLI to update the system. Use the recipes listed in FAS Recipes to update each supported type.\nNOTE: Each system is different and may not have all hardware options.\nCurrent Capabilities The following table describes the hardware items that can have their firmware updated via FAS. For more information about the upgradable targets, refer to the Firmware product stream repository.\nTable 1. Upgradable Firmware Items\n   Manufacturer Type Target     Cray nodeBMC BMC, Node0.BIOS, Node1.BIOS, Recovery, Node1.AccFPGA0, Node0.AccFPGA0   Cray chassisBMC BMC, Recovery   Cray routerBMC BMC, Recovery   Gigabyte nodeBMC BMC, BIOS   HPE nodeBMC iLO 5 (BMC aka 1 ), System ROM ,Redundant System ROM (BIOS aka 2)    Order Of Operations For each item in the Hardware Precedence Order:\n  Complete a dry-run:\n cray fas actions create {jsonfile} Note the ActionID! Poll the status of the action until the action state is completed:  cray fas actions describe {actionID} --format json      Interpret the outcome of the dry-run. Look at the counts and determine if the dry-run identified any hardware to update:\nFor the steps below, the following returned messages will help determine if a firmware update is needed. The following are end states for operations. The Firmware action itself should be in completed once all operations have finished.\n NoOp: Nothing to do, already at version. NoSol: No viable image is available; this will not be updated. succeeded: IF dryrun: The operation should succeed if performed as a live update. succeeded means that FAS identified that it COULD update a component name (xname) + target with the declared strategy. IF live update: the operation succeeded, and has updated the component name (xname) + target to the identified version. failed: IF dryrun: There is something that FAS could do, but it likely would fail; most likely because the file is missing. IF live update: the operation failed, the identified version could not be put on the component name (xname) + target.    If succeeded count \u0026gt; 0, now perform a live update.\n  Update the JSON file overrideDryrun to true:\n cray fas actions create {jsonfile} Note the ActionID! Poll the status of the action until the action state is completed:  cray fas actions describe {actionID} --format json      Interpret the outcome of the live update; proceed to next type of hardware.\n  Hardware Precedence Order After identifying which hardware is in the system, start with the top most item on this list to update. If any of the following hardware is not in the system, skip it.\nIMPORTANT:\n This process does not communicate the SAFE way to update NCNs. If the NCNs and their BMCs have not been locked, or FAS is blindly used to update NCNs without following the correct process, then THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE JEOPARDIZED. Read the corresponding recipes before updating. There are sometimes ancillary actions that must be completed in order to ensure update integrity.  NOTE to update Switch Controllers (sC) or RouterBMC refer to the Rosetta Documentation\n Cray  ChassisBMC NodeBMC  BMC NodeBIOS Redstone FPGA     Gigabyte  BMC BIOS   HPE  BMC (iLO5) BIOS (System ROM)    FAS Admin Procedures There are several use cases for using the FAS to update firmware on the system. These use cases are intended to be run by system administrators with a good understanding of firmware. Under no circumstances should non-administrator users attempt to use FAS or perform a firmware update.\n Perform a firmware update: Update the firmware of a component name (xname)\u0026rsquo;s target to the latest, earliest, or an explicit version. Determine what hardware can be updated by performing a dry-run: This is the easiest way to determine what can be updated. Take a snapshot of the system: Record the firmware versions present on each target for the identified component names (xnames). If the firmware version corresponds to an image available in the images repository, link the imageID to the record. Restore the snapshot of the system: Take the previously recorded snapshot and use the related imageIDs to put the component name (xname)/targets back to the firmware version they were at, at the time of the snapshot. Provide firmware for updating: FAS can only update a component name (xname)/target if it has an image record that is applicable. Most administrators will not encounter this use case.  Firmware Actions An action is collection of operations, which are individual firmware update tasks. Only one FAS action can be run at a time. Any other attempted action will be queued. Additionally, only one operation can be run on a component name (xname) at a time. For example, if there are 1000 component names (xnames) with 5 targets each to be updated, all 1000 component names (xnames) can be updating a target, but only 1 target on each component name (xname) will be updated at a time.\nThe life cycle of any action can be divided into the static and dynamic portions of the life cycle.\nThe static portion of the life cycle is where the action is created and configured. It begins with a request to create an action through either of the following requests:\n Direct: Request to /actions API. Indirect: Request to restore a snapshot via the /snapshots API.  The dynamic portion of the life cycle is where the action is executed to completion. It begins when the actions is transitioned from the new to configured state. The action will then be ultimately transitioned to an end state of aborted or completed.\nFirmware Operations Operations are individual tasks in a FAS action. FAS will create operations based on the configuration sent through the actions create command. FAS operations will have one of the following states:\n initial - Operation just created. configured - The operation is configured, but nothing has been started. blocked - Only one operation can be performed on a node at a time. If more than one update is required for a component name (xname), operations will be blocked. This will have a message of \u0026ldquo;blocked by sibling\u0026rdquo;. inProgress - Update is in progress, but not completed. verifying - Waiting for update to complete. failed - An update was attempted, but FAS is unable to tell that the update succeeded in the allotted time. noOperation - Firmware is at the correct version according to the images loaded into FAS. noSolution - FAS does not have a suitable image for an update. aborted - the operation was aborted before it could determine if it was successful. If aborted after the update command was sent to the node, the node may still have updated.  Firmware Images FAS requires images in order to update firmware for any device on the system. An image contains the data that allows FAS to establish a link between an admin command, available devices (xname/targets), and available firmware.\nThe following is an example of an image:\n{ \u0026#34;imageID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-05-11T17:11:07.017Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nodeBMC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;manufacturer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;intel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;s2600\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;s2600_REV_a\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;BIOS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;recovery\u0026#34;, default\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;firmwareVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f1.123.24xz\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;semanticFirmwareVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1.2.252\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;updateURI\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/redfish/v1/Systems/UpdateService/BIOS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;needManualReboot\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;waitTimeBeforeManualRebootSeconds\u0026#34;: 600, \u0026#34;waitTimeAfterRebootSeconds\u0026#34;: 180, \u0026#34;pollingSpeedSeconds\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;forceResetType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ForceRestart\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s3URL\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3://firmware/f1.1123.24.xz.iso\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowableDeviceStates\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;On\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Off\u0026#34; ] } The main components of an image are described below:\n  Key\nThis includes the deviceType, manufacturer, model, target, tag, semanticFirmwareVersion (firmware version) fields.\nThese fields are how administrators assess what firmware is on a device, and if an image is applicable to that device.\n  Process guides\nThis includes the forceResetType, pollingSpeedSeconds, waitTime(s), allowableDeviceStates fields.\nFAS gets information about how to update the firmware from these fields.

	"content": "Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (cray CLI) The cray command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management REST APIs into easily usable commands.\nLater procedures in the installation workflow use the cray CLI to interact with multiple services. The cray CLI configuration needs to be initialized for the Linux account, and the Keycloak user running the procedure needs to be authorized. This section describes how to initialize the cray CLI for use by a user and how to authorize that user.\nThe cray CLI only needs to be initialized once per user on a node.\nProcedure   Unset the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable, if previously set.\nSome of the installation procedures leading up to this point use the CLI with a Kubernetes managed service account that is normally used for internal operations. There is a procedure for extracting the OAUTH token for this service account and assigning it to the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable to permit simple CLI operations.\nncn# unset CRAY_CREDENTIALS   Initialize the cray CLI for the root account.\nThe cray CLI needs to know what host to use to obtain authorization and what user is requesting authorization, so it can obtain an OAUTH token to talk to the API Gateway. This is accomplished by initializing the CLI configuration. In this example, the \u0026lsquo;vers\u0026rsquo; username and its password are used.\nIf LDAP configuration was enabled, then use a valid account in LDAP instead of the example account \u0026lsquo;vers\u0026rsquo;.\nIf LDAP configuration was not enabled, or is not working, then a Keycloak local account could be created. See Configure Keycloak Account to create this local account in Keycloak and then use it instead of the example account \u0026lsquo;vers\u0026rsquo;.\nncn# cray init When prompted, remember to use the correct username instead of \u0026lsquo;vers\u0026rsquo;.

	"content": "VCS Branching Strategy Individual products import configuration content (Ansible plays, roles, and more) into a repository in the Version Control Service (VCS) through their installation process. Typically, this repository is of the following form and exists in the cray organization in VCS:\n[product name]-config-management The import branch of the product is considered \u0026ldquo;pristine content\u0026rdquo; and is added to VCS in a read-only branch. This step is taken to ensure the future updates of the product\u0026rsquo;s configuration content can be based on a clean branch, and that the upgrade procedure can proceed without merging issues.\nCray products import their content into a branch in the following format:\ncray/[product]/[product version] The version is in SemVer format. Product installation and operational workflows will direct users to create branches from these pristine product branches to begin customizing their configuration from the default provided by the HPE Cray product.\nThe workflow of branching from pristine imported content and handling upgrades to that content is shown in the diagram below (see \u0026ldquo;Branch Workflow\u0026rdquo;). In this scenario, the configuration customizations are made in a customer/main branch, which can be any branch in the repository, such as master, main, integration, or others. As configuration changes are made and the system is configured as required, users can point to the commits (white circles) in their CFS configuration layers to test and run Cray products on the system. Users may also point to the commits on pristine branches (blue circle) in CFS configuration layers if the default configuration is sufficient.\nWhen a product upgrade occurs (cray/product/1.4.0 in the above diagram), the product installer will create a new branch and commit based off the previous pristine branch. If the previous customizations on the customer/main branch also need to be included with the new 1.4.0 content, the user should initiate a Git merge of the new pristine content into their branch (or possibly into a test branch based on customer/main). This process will be the same for subsequent updates of the product as well.\n IMPORTANT: If the HPE Cray product has specific instructions for installing and upgrading configuration content, those should take precedence over this generic workflow.\n The \u0026ldquo;Branch Workflow\u0026rdquo; diagram is an example workflow that can be used to manage new product content being introduced during upgrades. However, CFS and VCS do not require any specific branching strategy. Users are free to manage the branches as they see fit with the exception of the pristine branches imported by individual Cray products. CFS configuration layers (see Configuration Layers) only require a Git commit ID, a Git repository clone URL, and the path to an Ansible playbook to run the configuration content in the repository.\n"

The following URL is for the VCS web interface:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME\nOn cluster nodes, the VCS service can be accessed through the gateway. VCS credentials for the crayvcs user are required before cloning a repository (see the \u0026ldquo;VCS Administrative User\u0026rdquo; section below). To clone a repository in the cray organization, use the following command:\nncn# git clone https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/REPO_NAME.git VCS Administrative User The Cray System Management (CSM) product installation creates the administrative user crayvcs that is used by CSM and other product installers to import their configuration content into VCS. The initial VCS credentials for the crayvcs user are obtained with the following command:\nncn# kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials \\ --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode The initial VCS login credentials for the crayvcs user are stored in three places:\n vcs-user-credentials Kubernetes secret: This is used to initialize the other two locations, as well as providing a place where other users can query for the password. VCS (Gitea): These credentials are used when pushing to Git using the default username and password. The password should be changed through the Gitea UI. Keycloak: These credentials are used to access the VCS UI. They must be changed through Keycloak. For more information on accessing Keycloak, see Access the Keycloak User Management UI.   WARNING: These three sources of credentials are not synced by any mechanism. Changing the default password requires that is it changed in all three places. Changing only one may result in difficulty determining the password at a later date, or may result in losing access to VCS altogether.\n To change the password in the vcs-user-credentials Kubernetes secret, use the following command:\nncn# kubectl create secret generic vcs-user-credentials --save-config \\ --from-literal=vcs_username=\u0026#34;crayvcs\u0026#34; \\ --from-literal=vcs_password=\u0026#34;NEW_PASSWORD\u0026#34; \\ --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f - The NEW_PASSWORD value must be replaced with the updated password.\nAccess the cray Gitea Organization The VCS UI uses Keycloak to authenticate users on the system.

As a result, users configured via Keycloak can log in and create organizations and repositories of their own, but they cannot modify the cray organization that is created during system installation unless they are given permissions to do so.\nThe crayvcs Gitea admin user that is created during CSM installation can log in to the UI via Keycloak. To allow users other than crayvcs to have access to repositories in the cray organization, use the following procedure:\n  Log in to VCS as the crayvcs user on the system:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME\n  Navigate to the cray organization owners page at the following location:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/cray/teams/owners\n  Enter the username of the user who should have access to the organization in the Search user\u0026hellip; text field, and click the Add Team Member button.\n   IMPORTANT The \u0026ldquo;Owner\u0026rdquo; role has full access to all repositories in the organization, as well as administrative access to the organization, including the ability to create and delete repositories.\n For granting non-administrative access to the organization and its repositories, create a new team at the following URL:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/org/cray/teams/new Select the permissions appropriately, and then navigate to the following URL to add members to the newly created team:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/org/cray/teams Backup and Restore Data Data for Gitea is stored in two places. Git content is stored directly in a PVC, while structural data, such as Gitea users and the list and attributes of repos, is stored in a Postgres database. Because of this, both sources must be backed up and restored together.\nBackup Postgres Data   Determine which Postgres member is the leader and exec into the leader pod to dump the data to a local file:\nncn-w001# kubectl exec gitea-vcs-postgres-0 -n services -c postgres -it -- patronictl list Example output:\n+ Cluster: gitea-vcs-postgres (6995618180238446669) -----+----+-----------+ | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +----------------------+--------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | gitea-vcs-postgres-0 | 10.45.0.21 | Leader | running | 1 | | | gitea-vcs-postgres-1 | 10.46.128.19 | | running | 1 | 0 | | gitea-vcs-postgres-2 | 10.47.0.21 | | running | 1 | 0 | +----------------------+--------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ ncn-w001# POSTGRES_LEADER=gitea-vcs-postgres-0 ncn-w001# kubectl exec -it ${POSTGRES_LEADER} -n services -c postgres -- pg_dumpall -c -U postgres \u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.sql   Determine what secrets are associated with the postgresql credentials:\nncn-w001# kubectl get secrets -n services | grep gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Example output:\npostgres.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d service-account.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d standby.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d   Export each secret to a manifest file:\nncn# SECRETS=\u0026quot;postgres service-account standby\u0026quot; ncn# echo \u0026quot;---\u0026quot; \u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest ncn# for secret in $SECRETS; do kubectl get secret \u0026quot;${secret}.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials\u0026quot; -n services -o yaml \u0026gt;\u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest echo \u0026quot;---\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest done   Edit the manifest file to remove creationTimestamp, resourceVersion, selfLink, uid for each entry. Then, copy all files to a safe location.\n  Backup PVC Data The VCS postgres backups should be accompanied by backups of the VCS PVC. The export process can be run at any time while the service is running using the following commands:\nBackup (save the resulting tar file to a safe location):\nncn# POD=$(kubectl -n services get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gitea -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.items[] | .metadata.name\u0026#39;) ncn# kubectl -n services exec ${POD} -- tar -cvf vcs.tar /data/ ncn# kubectl -n services cp ${POD}:vcs.tar ./vcs.tar Restore Postgres Data Restoring VCS from Postgres is documented here: Restore_Postgres.md\nRestore PVC Data When restoring the VCS postgres database, the PVC should also be restored to the same point in time. The restore process can be run at any time while the service is running using the following commands:\nRestore:\nncn# POD=$(kubectl -n services get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gitea -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.items[] | .metadata.name\u0026#39;) ncn# kubectl -n services cp ./vcs.tar ${POD}:vcs.tar ncn# kubectl -n services exec ${POD} -- tar -xvf vcs.tar ncn# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment gitea-vcs Alternative Backup/Restore Strategy An alternative to the separate backups of the postgres and pvc data is to backup the git data. This has the advantage that only one backup is needed and that the git backups can be imported into any git server, not just gitea, but has the disadvantage that some information about the gitea deployment is lost (such as user/org information) and may need to be recreated manually if the VCS deployment is lost.\nThe following scripts create/use a vcs-content directory that contains all git data.

	"content": "Write Ansible Code for CFS HPE Cray provides Ansible plays and roles for software products deemed necessary for the system to function. Customers are free to write their own Ansible plays and roles to augment what HPE Cray provides or implement new features. Basic knowledge of Ansible is needed to write plays and roles. The information below includes recommendations and best practices for writing and running Ansible code on the system successfully with the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nHelp with Ansible can be found in the external Ansible documentation:\n Ansible playbook best practices Ansible examples  Ansible Code Structure The Version Control Service (VCS) is setup during the Cray System Management (CSM) product installation, which is the appropriate place to store configuration content. Individual product installations include the Ansible code to properly configure each product.\nThe structure of the individual repository directories matches the recommended directory layout from the external Ansible documentation. The default playbook site.yml is found at the top level, if it exists, and the Ansible roles and variables are in their appropriate directories. Inventory directories like group_vars and host_vars may exist, but they are empty and left for variable overrides and customizations by the user.\nWrite Playbooks for Multiple Node Types Within an Ansible playbook, users can designate which node groups the various tasks and roles will run against. For example, a default site.yml playbook may contain a list of roles that are run on only the Compute nodes, and a list of roles that will run on only Application nodes. This is designated using the hosts parameter.\nFor example, hosts: Compute would be used to target the compute nodes. Users can create additional sections that target other node types, or adjust the hosts that the included roles will run against as necessary. It is also possible to target multiple groups within a section of a playbook, or to specify complex targets, such as nodes that are in one group and not in another group. The syntax for this is available in the external Ansible documentation. Hosts can be in more than one group at a time if there are user-defined groups. In this case, Ansible will run all sections that match the node type against the node.\nSee the Ansible Inventory section for more information about groups that are made automatically available through CFS dynamic inventory.\nPerformance and Scaling Tips CFS will handle scaling up Ansible to run on many hosts, but there are still places where performance can be improved by correctly writing Ansible plays.\n Use image customization when possible to limit how many times a task is run and improve boot times. Configuration that is the same for all nodes of the same type will benefit from image customization. See the next section for how to target specific tasks for running only during image customization. Import roles rather than playbooks. Each time a new playbook starts, Ansible automatically gathers facts for all the systems it is running against. This is not necessary more than once and can slow down Ansible execution. Turn off facts that are not needed in a playbook by setting gather_facts: false. If only a few facts are required, it is also possible to limit fact gathering by setting gather_subset. For more information on gather_subset, see the external Ansible module setup documentation. Use loops rather than individual tasks where modules are called multiple times. Some Ansible modules will optimize the command, such as grouping package installations into a single transaction (Refer to the external Ansible playbook loops documentation).  "

	"content": "Target Ansible Tasks for Image Customization The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) enables Ansible playbooks to run against both running nodes and images. See the \u0026ldquo;Use Cases\u0026rdquo; header in the Configuration Management section for more information about image customization and when it should be used.\nCFS uses the cray_cfs_image variable to distinguish between node personalization (running on live nodes) and image customization (configuring an image prior to boot). When this variable is set to true, it indicates that the CFS session is an image customization type and the playbook is targeting an image.\nCFS automatically sets this variable in the hosts/01-cfs-generated.yaml file for all sessions. When the session target is image customization, it sets cray_cfs_image to true; otherwise, it is false.\ncray_cfs_image can be set with Ansible playbook conditionals to selectively run individual tasks with when: cray_cfs_image, or to ignore individual tasks with when: not cray_cfs_image.\nConditionals can also be applied to entire roles if desired (see the external apply Ansible conditionals to roles). In instances where the same playbook may be run in both modes, it is best practice to include a conditional on all parts of the playbook, or at least those that take significant time so that work is not duplicated.\nIt is also best practice to include a default in Ansible roles for playbook and role portability because CFS injects this variable at runtime. This can be done in the defaults section of the role, or where the variable is called. For example:\nwhen: \u0026#34;{{ cray_cfs_image | default(false) }}\u0026#34; If a default is not provided, any playbooks or roles will not be runnable outside of the CFS Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) without the user specifying cray_cfs_image in the vars files or with the Ansible extra-vars options.\nWhen running Ansible against an IMS-hosted image root during an image customization CFS session, there are no special requirements for the paths when copying or syncing files. The image root directories will appears as if Ansible is connecting to a regular, live node. However, the image is not a running node, so actions that require a running system, such as starting/reloading a service, will not work properly and will cause the Ansible play to fail. Actions like these should be done only during live-node configuration modes such as node personalization.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Customize Configuration Values In general, most systems will require some customization from the default values provided by HPE Cray products. As stated in the previous section, these changes cannot be made on the pristine product branches that are imported during product installation and upgrades. Changes can only be made in Git branches that are based on the pristine branches.\nChanging or overriding default values should be done in accordance with Ansible best practices (see the external Ansible best practices guide) and variable precedence (see the external Ansible variable guide) in mind.\nThe following practices should also be followed:\n When it is necessary to add more functionality beyond an Ansible playbook provided by an HPE Cray product, include the product playbook in a new playbook instead of modifying it directly. Any modifications to a product playbook will result in a merge being required during a product upgrade. Do not modify default Ansible role variables, override all values using inventory (group_vars and host_vars directories). Cray products do not import any content to inventory locations, so merges of new product content will not cause conflicts if variables are located in inventory. Do not put any sensitive or secret information, such as passwords, in the Git repository. These values should be pulled during runtime from an external key management system.  Handling Sensitive Information Passwords and other sensitive content should not be stored in a Version Control Service (VCS) repository. Instead, consider writing Ansible tasks/roles that pull the value in dynamically while the playbook is running from an external secrets management system.\nAt this time, the Ansible Vault is not supported by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nExample: Override a Role Default Value To override a value that is defined in an Ansible role in a configuration repository, set the value in the Ansible inventory. If the override pertains to an entire Ansible group of nodes, create a file as follows:\n  Clone the configuration repository.\n  Checkout the branch that will include the change, or create a new branch.\n  Capture the variable name in the roles/[role name]/defaults/main.yml file.\n  Create a new directory and edit a file with the role name.\nncn# mkdir -p group_vars/all \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch group_vars/all/[role name].yml   Set the variable to a new value in the file.\nncn# echo \u0026#39;[variable name]: [new variable value]\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; group_vars/all/[role name].yml   Stage the file in the Git branch, commit it, and promote the change.\n  This change will be applied to all nodes by using the group name all. To narrow the variable scope to a specific group (Compute for example), use the group name instead of all as follows:\nncn# mkdir -p group_vars/Compute \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch group_vars/Compute/[role name].yml ncn# echo \u0026#39;[variable name]: [new variable value]\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; group_vars/Compute/[role name].yml To narrow the variable scope to a single node create the file in the host_vars/[node xname]/[role name].yaml and override the value.\nThe name of the created file is largely inconsequential. The identified best practice is to include the name of the role in the created file for reasons of maintainability and discoverability. However, be aware that the file name matters when multiple files in the same directory contain the same variable with different values. In that case, use a single all.yml file rather than a directory, or use files names with import ordering in mind. See the external Ansible documentation for more information on how variables precedence is handled.\nTo override role variables for roles that exist across multiple repositories, consider using the CFS Additional Inventory feature. See Manage Multiple Inventories in a Single Location.\nExample: Add or Remove Functionality to a Provided Playbook To add more functionality to a playbook provided by a configuration repository, it is considered best practice to leave the existing playbook unmodified (if possible) to not have merge conflicts when new versions of the playbook are installed. For instance, if a site.yml playbook needs to be extended with a custom site-custom.yml playbook, consider creating a new playbook that imports and runs them both. For example, the site-all.yml playbook.\nncn# cat site-all.yml - import_playbook: site.yml - import_playbook: site-custom.yml See the external Ansible documentation on re-using playbooks.\nTo remove a role from a provided playbook, the best practice is to determine if the role provides a variable to skip the roles tasks altogether. See the roles/[role name]/README file for a listing of the role variables.\nIf changes to role variables are not able to skip the role, the role may be commented out in the playbook. However, note that an upgrade to the configuration will result in a merge conflict because of the changes made in the playbook if the upgrade pristine branch is merged with the branch containing the commented playbook.\n"

Use the CFS --ansible-limit option when creating a session to apply the limits. The option directly corresponds to the --limit option offered by ansible-playbook, and can be used to specify hosts, groups, or combinations of them with patterns. CFS passes the value of this option directly to the ansible-playbook command for each configuration layer in the session. See the Ansible documentation on Patterns: targeting hosts and groups.\n IMPORTANT: The --limit option is useful for temporarily limiting the scope of targets for a configuration session. For example, it could be used to target a subset of the Compute group that has been separated for development use.

	"content": "Configuration Management The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is available on systems for remote execution and configuration management of nodes and boot images. This includes nodes available in the Hardware State Manager (HSM) inventory (compute, management, and application nodes), and boot images hosted by the Image Management Service (IMS).\nCFS configures nodes and images via a gitops methodology. All configuration content is stored in a version control service (VCS), and is managed by authorized system administrators. CFS provides a scalable Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) for the configuration to be applied with flexible inventory and node targeting options.\nUse Cases CFS is available for the following use cases on systems:\n Image customization: Pre-configure bootable images available via IMS. This use case enables partitioning a full configuration of a target node. Non-node-specific settings are applied pre-boot, which reduces the amount of configuration required after a node boots, and therefore reduces the bring-up time for nodes. Post-boot configuration: Fully configure or reconfigure booted nodes in a scalable, performant way to add the required settings. \u0026ldquo;Push-based\u0026rdquo; deployment: When using post-boot configuration with only node-specific configuration data, the target undergoes node personalization. The two-step process of pre-boot image customization and post-boot node personalization results in a fully configured node, optimized for minimal bring-up times. \u0026ldquo;Pull-based\u0026rdquo; deployment: Provide configuration management to nodes by prescribing a desired configuration state and ensuring the current node configuration state matches the desired state automatically. This is achieved via the CFS Hardware Synchronization Agent and the CFS Batcher implementation.  CFS Components CFS is comprised of a group of services and components interacting within the Cray System Management (CSM) service mesh, and provides a means for system administrators to configure nodes and boot images via Ansible. CFS includes the following components:\n A REST API service. A command-line interface (CLI) to the API (via the cray cfs command). Pre-packaged AEE(s) with values tuned for performant configuration for executing Ansible playbooks, and reporting plug-ins for communication with CFS. The CFS Hardware Sync Agent, which pulls in node information from the system inventory to the CFS database to track the node configuration state. The CFS Batcher, which manages the configuration state of system components (nodes).  Although it is not a formal part of the service, CFS integrates with a Gitea instance (VCS) running in the CSM service mesh for management of the configuration content life-cycle.\nHigh-Level Configuration Workflow CFS remotely executes Ansible configuration content on nodes or boot images with the following workflow:\n Creating a configuration with one or more layers within a specific Git repository, and committing it to be executed by Ansible. Targeting a node, boot image, or group of nodes to apply the configuration. Creating a configuration session to apply and track the status of Ansible, applying each configuration layer to the targets specified in the session metadata.  Additionally, configuration management of specific components (nodes) can also be achieved by doing the following:\n Creating a configuration with one or more layers within a specific Git repository, and committing it to be executed by Ansible. Setting the desired configuration state of a node to the prescribed layers. Enabling the CFS Batcher to automatically configure nodes by creating one or more configuration sessions to apply the configuration layer(s).  "

The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) contains a database of the configuration state of available hardware known to the Hardware State Manager (HSM). When new nodes are added to the HSM database, a CFS Hardware Sync Agent enters the component into the CFS database with a null state of configuration.\nAdministrators are able to set a desired CFS configuration for each component, and the CFS Batcher ensures the desired configuration state and the current configuration state match.\nAutomatic Configuration Whenever CFS detects that the desired configuration does not match the current configuration state, CFS Batcher will automatically start a CFS session to apply the necessary configuration. See Configuration Management with CFS Batcher for more information.\nThere are several situations that will cause automatic configuration:\n When rebooted, components that have the cfs-state-reporter package installed will register a null current configuration, resulting in a full configuration. When a configuration is updated, all components with that desired configuration will automatically get updates for the layers of the configuration that have changed. If a configuration is only partially applied because of a previous failed configuration session and the component has not exceeded its maximum retries, it will be configured with any layers of the configurations that have not yet been successfully applied. When a user manually resets the configuration state of a component, it will force reconfiguration without rebooting a node. If a manual CFS session applies a version of a playbook that conflicts with the version in the desired configuration, CFS will re-apply the desired version after the manual session is completed. Any other situation that causes the desired state to not match with the current state of a component will trigger automatic configuration. CFS only tracks the current state of components as they are configured by CFS sessions. It does not track configuration state created or modified by other tooling on the system.  View Component Configuration Configuration status of a given component (using the component name (xname)) is available through the cray cfs components describe command.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Configuration Management with the CFS Batcher Creating configuration sessions with the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) enables remote execution for configuring live nodes and boot images prior to booting. CFS also provides its Batcher component for configuration management of registered system components. The CFS Batcher periodically examines the aggregated configuration state of registered components and schedules CFS sessions against those that have not been configured to their desired state. The frequency of scheduling, the maximum number of components to schedule in the same CFS session, and the expiration time for scheduling less than full sessions are configurable.\nThe CFS-Batcher schedules CFS sessions according to the following rules:\n Components are assigned to a batch if they need configuration, are not disabled, and are currently not assigned to a batch.  Components are grouped according to their desired state information. A new batch is created if no partial batches match the desired state, and all similar batches are full.   Batches are scheduled as CFS sessions when the batch is full or the batch window time has been exceeded.  The timer for the batch window is started when the first component is added, and is never reset. Nodes should never wait more than the window period between being ready for configuration and being scheduled in a CFS session.   CFS cannot guarantee that jobs for similar batches will start at the same time, even if all CFS sessions are created at the same time. This variability is due to the nature of Kubernetes scheduling.  Checking the start time for the CFS session is more accurate than checking the pod start time when determining when a batch was scheduled.    There are two safety mechanisms built into the Batcher scheduling that can delay batches more than the usual amount of time. Both mechanisms are indicated in the logs:\n CFS Batcher will not schedule multiple sessions to configure the same component. Batcher monitors on-going sessions that it started so that if one session is started and the desired configuration changes, Batcher can wait until the initial session is completed before scheduling the component with the new configuration to a new session.  If Batcher is restarted, it will attempt to rebuild its state based on sessions with the \u0026ldquo;batcher-\u0026rdquo; naming scheme that are still in progress. This ensures that scheduling conflicts will not occur even if Batcher is restarted. On restart, some information on the in-flight sessions is lost, so this wait ensures that the Batcher does not schedule multiple configuration sessions for the same component at the same time.   If several CFS sessions that are created by the Batcher Agent fail in a row (the most recent 20 sessions), Batcher will start throttling the creation of new sessions.  The throttling is automatically reset if a single session succeeds. Users can also manually reset this by restarting Batcher. The back-off is increased if new sessions continue to fail. This helps protect against cases where high numbers of retries are allowed so that Batcher cannot flood Kubernetes with new jobs in a short period of time.    Configure Batcher Several Batcher behaviors are configurable. All of the Batcher configuration is available through the CFS options:\n# cray cfs options list | grep -i batch Example output:\nbatchSize = 25 batchWindow = 60 batcherCheckInterval = 10 defaultBatcherRetryPolicy = 3 See CFS Global Options for more information. Use the cray cfs options update command to change these values as needed.\nReview the following information about CFS Batcher options before changing the defaults. Setting these to non-optimal values may affect system performance. The optimal values will depend on system size and the specifics of the configuration layers that will be applied in the sessions created by CFS Batcher.\n  batchSize\nThis option determines the maximum number of components that will be included in each session created by CFS Batcher.\nThe default value is 25 components per session.\n WARNING: Increasing this value will result in fewer batcher-created sessions, but will also require more resources for Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) containers to do the configuration.\n   batchWindow\nThis option sets the number of seconds that CFS batcher will wait before scheduling a CFS session when the number of components needing configuration has not reached the batchSize limit. CFS Batcher will immediately create a session when the batchSize limit is reached. However, in the case where there are few components or long periods of time between components notifying CFS Batcher of the need for configuration, the batchWindow will time-box the creation of sessions so no component needs to wait for the queue to fill.\nThe default value is 60 seconds.\n WARNING: Lower values will cause CFS Batcher to be more responsive to creating sessions, but values too low may result in degraded performance of both the CFS APIs as well as the overall system.\n   batcherCheckInterval\nThis option sets how often CFS batcher checks for components waiting to be configured. This value must be lower than batchWindow value.\nThe default value is 10 seconds.\n WARNING: Lower values will cause CFS Batcher to be more responsive to creating sessions, but values too low may result in degraded performance of the CFS APIs on larger systems.\n   defaultBatcherRetryPolicy\nWhen a component (node) requiring configuration fails to configure from a previous configuration session launched by CFS Batcher, the error is logged. defaultBatcherRetryPolicy is the maximum number of failed configurations allowed per component before CFS Batcher will stop attempts to configure the component.\nThis value can be overridden on a per component basis.\n  List CFS Batcher Sessions The CFS Batcher prepends all CFS session names it creates with batcher-. Sessions that have be created by CFS Batcher are found by using the following command with the --name-contains option:\n# cray cfs sessions list --name-contains batcher- To list the batcher sessions that are currently running, filter with the cray cfs sessions list command options:\n# cray cfs sessions list --name-contains batcher- --status running Use the cray cfs sessions list --help command output for all filtering options, including session age, tags, status, and success.\nMap CFS Batcher Sessions to BOS Sessions To find all of the sessions created by the CFS Batcher because of configuration requests made by a specific Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session, filter the sessions by the name of the BOS session, which is added as a tag on the sessions. The BOS session ID is required to run the following command.\n# cray cfs sessions list --tags bos_session=BOS_SESSION_ID "

	"content": "Configuration Sessions Once configurations have been created with the required layers and values set in the configuration repositories (or the additional inventory repository), create a Configuration Framework Session (CFS) session to apply the configuration to the targets.\nSessions are created via the Cray CLI or through the CFS REST API. A session stages Ansible inventory (whether dynamic, static, or image customization), launches Ansible Execution Environments (AEE) in order for each configuration layer in the service mesh, tears down the environments as required, and reports the session status to the CFS API.\nWhen a session target is an Image Management Service (IMS) image ID for the purposes of pre-boot image customization, the CFS session workflow varies slightly. The inventory staging instead calls IMS to expose the requested image root(s) via SSH. After the AEE(s) finish applying the configuration layers, CFS then instructs IMS to tear down the image root environment and package up the resultant image and records the new image ID in the session metadata.\nSession Naming Conventions CFS follows the same naming conventions for session names as Kubernetes does for jobs. Session names must follow the Kubernetes naming conventions and are limited to 45 characters.\nRefer to the external Kubernetes naming conventions documentation for more information.\nConfiguration Session Filters CFS provides several filters for use when listing sessions or using the bulk delete option. These following filters are available:\n  --status: Session status options include pending, running, and complete.\n  --succeeded: If the session has not yet completed, this will be set to none. Otherwise, this will be set to true, false, or unknown in the event that CFS was unable to find the Kubernetes job associated with the session.\n  --min-age/--max-age: Returns only the sessions that fall within the given age. For example, --max-age could be used to list only the recent sessions, or --min-age could be used to find old sessions for cleanup. Age is given in the format \u0026ldquo;1d\u0026rdquo; for days, or \u0026ldquo;6h\u0026rdquo; for hours.\n  --tags: Sessions can be created with searchable tags. By default, this includes the bos_session tag when CFS is triggered by BOS. This can be searched using the following command:\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list --tags bos_session=BOS_SESSION_NAME   Configuration Session Workflow CFS progresses through a session by running a series of commands in containers located in a Kubernetes job pod. Four container types are present in the job pod which pertain to CFS session setup, execution, and teardown:\n  git-clone-*\nThese init containers are responsible for cloning the configuration repository and checking out the branch/commit specified in each configuration layer.\nThese containers are run in the same order as the layers are specified, and their names are indexed appropriately: git-clone-0, git-clone-1, and so on.\n  git-clone-hosts\nThis init container clones the repository specified in the parameter additionalInventoryUrl, if specified.\n  inventory\nThis container is responsible for generating the dynamic inventory or for communicating to IMS to stage boot image roots that need to be made available via SSH when the session --target-definition is image.\n  ansible-*\nThese containers run the AEE after CFS injects the inventory and Git repository content from previous containers. One container is executed for each configuration layer specified.\nThese containers are run in the same order as the layers are specified, and their names are indexed appropriately: ansible-0, ansible-1, and so on.\n  teardown\nThis container waits for the last ansible-* to complete and subsequently calls IMS to package up customized image roots. The container only exists when the session --target-definition is image.\n  "

IMS will then provide SSH connection information to each image root that CFS will use to configure Ansible.\nUsers can expect that staging the image and generating an inventory will be a longer process than creating a session with other target definitions (for example, inventories).

	"content": "Ansible Inventory The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) provides several options for targeting nodes or boot images for configuration by Ansible. The contents of the Ansible inventory determine which nodes are available for configuration in each CFS session and how default configuration values can be customized.\nThe following are the inventory options provided by CFS:\n Dynamic inventory Static inventory Image Customization  Dynamic Inventory and Host Groups Dynamic inventory is the default inventory when creating a CFS session. CFS automatically generates an Ansible hosts file with data provided by the Hardware State Manager (HSM) when using a dynamic inventory. CFS automatically generates Ansible hosts groups for each group defined in HSM and creates Ansible host groups for nodes based on hardware roles and sub-roles.\nRetrieve a list of HSM groups with the following command:\nncn# cray hsm groups list --format json | jq .[].label These groups can be referenced in Ansible plays or when creating a CFS session directly.\nHardware roles and sub-roles are available as [Role] and [Role]_[Subrole] Ansible host groups. For instance, if targeting just the nodes with the \u0026ldquo;Application\u0026rdquo; role, the host group name is Application. If targeting just the sub-role \u0026ldquo;UAN\u0026rdquo;, which is a sub-role of the \u0026ldquo;Application\u0026rdquo; role, the host group name provided by CFS is Application_UAN. See HSM Roles and Subroles for more information.\nConsult the cray-hms-base-config Kubernetes ConfigMap in the services namespace for a listing of the available roles and sub-roles on the system.\nDuring a CFS session, the dynamic inventory is generated and placed in the hosts/01-cfs-generated.yaml file, relative to the configuration management repository root defined in the current configuration layer. Refer to the external Ansible Inventory documentation for more information about managing inventory, as well as variable precedence within multiple inventory files.\nCFS prefixes its dynamic inventory file with 01- so that its variables can be easily overridden as needed because Ansible reads inventory files in lexicographic order.\nStatic Inventory Even though CFS uses dynamic inventory and the HSM groups, roles, and sub-roles to enable specific targeting of groups of nodes, it is also possible to target nodes within the system using a static inventory file. To do so, each node must be listed in an inventory file itself. This approach is useful for testing configuration changes on a small scale.\nCreate a static inventory file in a hosts directory at the root of the configuration management repository in Ansible INI format. For example, create it in a branch and persist the changes.\nIn the following example, this is done for a single node in static inventory:\nncn# mkdir -p hosts; cd hosts; cat \u0026gt; static \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF [test_nodes] x3000c0s25b0n0 EOF ncn# cd ..; git add hosts/static ncn# git commit -m \u0026#34;Added a single test node to static inventory\u0026#34; ncn# git push The process can be used to include any nodes in the system reachable over the Node Management Network (NMN), which contains the public SSH key pair provisioned by the install process. This inventory information will only be located in the repository to which it is added. If the desired configuration contains multiple layers, use the additionalInventoryUrl option in CFS to provide inventory information on a per-session level instead of a per-repository level. Refer to Manage Multiple Inventories in a Single Location for more information.\nImage Customization CFS handles inventory for image customization differently because this type of configuration session does not target live nodes. When creating a configuration session meant to customize a boot image, the Image Management Service (IMS) image IDs are used as hosts and grouped according to input to the session creation.\nSee Create an Image Customization CFS Session for more information.\n"

This workflow depicts how services interact with each other during the compute node upgrade process, and helps to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nUpgrade Compute Nodes Use Cases: Administrator upgrades select compute nodes (around 500) to a newer compute image by using Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS).\nRequirement The compute nodes are up and running and their workloads are managed by Slurm.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of CRUS with Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) and Slurm (Workload Manager).\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) allows an administrator to modify the boot image and/or configuration on a set of compute nodes without the need to take the entire set of nodes out of service at once. It manages the workload management status of nodes, quiescing each node before taking the node out of service, upgrading the node, rebooting the node into the upgraded state and then returning the node to service within the workload manager. Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. The Boot Orchestration Service has the following components:  Boot Orchestration Session Template is a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and parameters. Boot Orchestration Session carries out an operation. The possible operations in a session are boot, shutdown, reboot, and configure. Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) is automatically launched to execute the session. A BOA executes the given operation, and if the operation is a boot or a reboot, it also configures the nodes post-boot (if configure is enabled).   Slurm has a component called slurmctld that runs on a non-compute node in a container. The Slurm control daemon or slurmctld is the central management daemon of Slurm. It monitors all other Slurm daemons and resources, accepts jobs, and allocates resources to those jobs. Slurm also has a component called slurmd that runs on all compute nodes. The Slurm daemon or slurmd monitors all tasks running on the compute node, accepts tasks, launches tasks, and kills running tasks upon request.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occur during this workflow.\n  Administrator creates HSM groups and populates the starting group\nCreate three HSM groups with starting, failed, and upgrading labels.\nFor example: crusfailed, crusupgrading, and crus_starting.\nAdd all of the 500 compute nodes to be updated to the crus_starting group. Leave the failed and upgrading groups empty.\n  Administrator creates a session template\nCreate a BOS session template which points to the new image, the desired CFS configuration, and with a boot set which includes all the compute nodes to be updated. The boot set can include additional nodes, but it must contain all the nodes that need to be updated. The BOS session template you use should specify \u0026ldquo;upgrading_label\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;node_groups\u0026rdquo; field of one of its boot sets.\nFor example: newcomputetemplate.\n  Administrator creates a CRUS session\nA new upgrade session is launched as a result of this call.\nSpecify the following parameters:\n  failed_label: An empty Hardware State Manager (HSM) group which CRUS will populate with any nodes that fail their upgrades.\n  starting_label: An HSM group which contains the total set of nodes to be upgraded. Example: 500.\n  upgrading_label: An empty HSM group which CRUS will use to boot and configure the discrete sets of nodes.\n  upgradestepsize: The number of nodes to include in each discrete upgrade step.\nThe upgrade steps will never exceed this quantity, although in some cases they may be smaller. Example: 50\n  upgradetemplateid: The name of the BOS session template to use for the upgrades. A session template is a collection of metadata for a group of nodes and their desired configuration.\n  workloadmanagertype: Currently only slurm is supported.\n    CRUS to HSM\nCRUS calls HSM to find the nodes in the starting_label group.\n  CRUS to HSM\nIt then takes a number of these nodes equal to the step size (50), and calls HSM to put them into the upgrading_label group.\n  CRUS to Slurm\nCRUS tells Slurm to quiesce these nodes. As each node is quiesced, Slurm puts the node offline.\n  Slurm to CRUS\nSlurm reports back to CRUS that all of the nodes as offline.\n  CRUS to BOS\nCRUS calls BOS to create a session with the following arguments:\n operation: reboot templateUuid: upgradetemplateid limit: upgrading_label    CRUS retrieves the BOA job details from BOS\nCRUS retrieves the BOS session to get the BOA job name. CRUS waits for the BOA job to finish.\nCRUS looks at the exit code of the BOA job to determine whether or not there were errors.\nIf there were errors, CRUS adds the nodes from the upgrading_label group into the failed_label group.\n  CRUS to HSM\nAfter the BOA job is complete, CRUS calls HSM to empty the upgrading_label group.\n  CRUS repeats steps for remaining nodes, then updates status\nCRUS repeats steps 5-10 until all of the nodes from the starting_label group have gone through these steps. After this, CRUS marks the session status as \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo;.\n  "

All of the traffic bound for the DHCP server, TFTP server, and Boot Script Service (BSS) is sent on the Node Management Network (NMN).\nIn the current arrangement, all three services are located on a non-compute node (NCN). Thus, traffic must first travel through the NCN to reach these services inside their pods.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Troubleshoot UAN Boot Issues Use this topic to guide troubleshooting of UAN boot issues.\nThe UAN boot process BOS boots UANs. BOS uses session templates to define various parameters such as:\n Which nodes to boot Which image to boot Kernel parameters Whether to perform post-boot configuration (Node Personalization) of the nodes by CFS. Which CFS configuration to use if Node Personalization is enabled.  UAN boots are performed in three phases:\n PXE booting an iPXE binary that will load the initrd of the wanted UAN image to boot. Booting the initrd (dracut) image which configures the UAN for booting the UAN image. This process consists of two phases.  Configuring the UAN node to use the Content Projection Service (CPS) and Data Virtualization Service (DVS). These services manage the UAN image rootfs mounting and make that image available to the UAN nodes. Mounting the rootfs   Booting the UAN image rootfs.  PXE Issues Most failures to PXE are the result of misconfigured network switches and/or BIOS settings. The UAN must PXE boot over the Node Management Network (NMN) and the switches must be configured to allow connectivity to the NMN. The cable for the NMN must be connected to the first port of the OCP card on HPE DL325 and DL385 nodes or to the first port of the built-in LAN-On-Motherboard (LOM) on Gigabyte nodes.\nInitrd (Dracut) Issues Dracut failures are often caused by the wrong interface being named nmn0, or by having multiple entries for the UAN component name (xname) in DNS. The latter is a result of multiple interfaces making DHCP requests. Either condition can cause IP address mismatches in the dvs_node_map. DNS configures entries based on DHCP leases.\nWhen dracut starts, it renames the network device named by the ifmap=netX:nmn0 kernel parameter to nmn0. This interface is the only one dracut will enable DHCP on. The ip=nmn0:dhcp kernel parameter limits dracut to DHCP only nmn0. The ifmap value must be set correctly in the kernel_parameters field of the BOS session template.\nFor UAN nodes that have more than one PCI card installed, ifmap=net2:nmn0 is the correct setting. If only one PCI card is installed, ifmap=net0:nmn0 is normally the correct setting.\nUANs require CPS and DVS to boot from images. These services are configured in dracut to retrieve the rootfs and mount it. If the image fails to download, check that DVS and CPS are both healthy, and DVS is running on all worker nodes. Run the following commands to check DVS and CPS:\nncn-m001# kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; --no-headers Example output:\nncn-w001 ncn-w002 ncn-m001# for node in `kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; --no-headers`; do ssh $node \u0026#34;lsmod | grep \u0026#39;^dvs \u0026#39;\u0026#34; Example output:\ndone ncn-w001 ncn-w002 If DVS and CPS are both healthy, then both of these commands will return all the worker NCNs in the HPE Cray EX system.\nImage Boot Issues Once dracut exits, the UAN will boot the rootfs image. Failures seen in this phase tend to be failures of spire-agent, cfs-state-reporter, or both, to start. The cfs-state-reporter tells BOA that the node is ready and allows BOA to start CFS for Node Personalization. If cfs-state-reporter does not start, check if the spire-agent has started. The cfs-state-reporter depends on the spire-agent. Running systemctl status spire-agent will show that that service is enabled and running if there are no issues with that service. Similarly, running systemctl status cfs-state-reporter will show a status of SUCCESS.\n  Verify the spire-agent service is enabled and running.\nuan# systemctl status spire-agent Example output:\n● spire-agent.service - SPIRE Agent Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/spire-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:27:33 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3581 (spire-agent) Tasks: 57 CGroup: /system.slice/spire-agent.service └─3581 /usr/bin/spire-agent run -expandEnv -config /root/spire/conf/spire-agent.conf   Verify cfs-state-reporter is healthy and returns SUCCESS.\nuan# systemctl status cfs-state-reporter Example output:\n● cfs-state-reporter.service - cfs-state-reporter reports configuration level of the system Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cfs-state-reporter.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:29:51 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3827 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)   "

Procedure Because the parameters that must be specified in the PUT command are lengthy, this procedure shows a simple bash script (not to be confused with iPXE boot scripts) to enter the boot information into BSS. The first step creates a script that can use either node ID (NID) or host name to identify the node(s) with which to associate the boot information.\n  Create a bash script to enter the following boot information into BSS in preparation for booting one or more nodes identified by NID or host name.\n  NCN = the host name of a non-compute node (NCN) that is a Kubernetes master node.

For more information, see Access to System Management Services.\n  KERNEL = the download URL of the kernel image artifact that was uploaded to S3, which is in the s3://s3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/kernel format.\n  INITRD = the download URL of the initrd image artifact that was uploaded to S3, which is in the s3://s3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/initrd format.\n  PARAMS = the boot kernel parameters.\nIMPORTANT: The PARAMS line must always include the substring crashkernel=360M. This enables node dumps, which are needed to troubleshoot node crashes.\n  NIDS = a list of node IDs of the nodes to be booted.\n  HOSTS = a list of strings identifying by host name the nodes to be booted.\n  The following script is generic. A script with specific values is below this one.\n#!/bin/bash NCN=api-gw-service-nmn.local KERNEL=s3://S3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/initrd INITRD=s3://S3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/kernel PARAMS=\u0026quot;STRING_WITH_BOOT_PARAMETERS crashkernel=360M\u0026quot; # # By NID NIDS=NID1,NID2,NID3 cray bss bootparameters create --nids $NIDS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS # # By host name #HOSTS=\u0026quot;STRING_IDENTIFYING_HOST1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;STRING_IDENTIFYING_HOST2\u0026quot; #cray bss bootparameters create --hosts $HOSTS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS BSS supports a mechanism that allows for a default boot setup, rather than needing to specify boot details for each specific node. The HOSTS value should be set to \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; in order to utilize the default boot setup. This feature is particular useful with larger systems.\nThe following script has specific values for the kernel/initrd image names, the kernel parameters, and the list of NIDS and hosts.\n#!/bin/bash NCN=api-gw-service-nmn.local KERNEL=s3://boot-images/97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb/kernel INITRD=s3://boot-images/97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb/initrd PARAMS=\u0026quot;console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 initrd=97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb root=nfs:$NCN:/var/lib/nfsroot/cmp000001_image rw nofb selinux=0 rd.net.timeout.carrier=20 crashkernel=360M\u0026quot; PARAMS=\u0026quot;console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 initrd=${INITRD##*/} \\ root=nfs:10.2.0.1:$NFS_IMAGE_ROOT_DIR rw nofb selinux=0 rd.shell crashkernel=360M \\ ip=dhcp rd.neednet=1 htburl=https://10.2.100.50/apis/hbtd/hmi/v1/heartbeat\u0026quot; # # By NID NIDS=1 cray bss bootparameters create --nids $NIDS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS # # By host name #HOSTS=\u0026quot;nid000001-nmn\u0026quot; #cray bss bootparameters create --hosts $HOSTS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS   Run the bash script to upload the boot information to BSS for the identified nodes.\nlocalhost# chmod +x script.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./script.sh   View the boot script.\nThis will show the specific boot script that will be passed to a given node when requesting a boot script.

	"content": "BOS Session Templates Describes the contents of a BOS session template.\nA session template can be created by specifying parameters as part of the call to the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS). When calling BOS directly, JSON is passed as part of the call.\nSession templates can be used to boot images that are customized with the Image Management Service (IMS). A session template has a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and kernel parameters used to boot them. This information is written to the Boot Script Service (BSS) and sent to each node over the specified network, enabling these nodes to boot.\nThe Simple Storage Service (S3) is used to store the manifest.json file that is created by IMS. This file contains links to all of the boot artifacts. The following S3 parameters are used in a BOS session template:\n type: This is the type of storage used. Currently, the only allowable value is s3. path: This is the path to the manifest.json file in S3. The path will follow the s3://\u0026lt;BUCKET_NAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;KEY_NAME\u0026gt; format. etag: This entity tag helps identify the version of the manifest.json file.

Boot sets sharing the same ordinal number will be addressed at the same time.\nEach boot set needs its own set of S3 parameters (path, type, and optionally etag).\nSpecify Nodes in a BOS Session Template There are three different ways to specify the nodes inside a boot set in a BOS session template. The node list, node groups, or node role groups values can be used. Each can be specified as a comma-separated list.\n  Node list\nThe \u0026quot;node_list\u0026quot; value is a list of nodes identified by component names (xnames).\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_list\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;x3000c0s19b1n0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000c0s19b1n1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000c0s19b2n0\u0026#34;]   Node groups\nThe \u0026quot;node_groups\u0026quot; value is a list of groups defined by the Hardware State Manager (HSM). Each group may contain zero or more nodes. Groups can be arbitrarily defined.\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_groups\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;white\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pink\u0026#34;]   Node roles groups\nThe node role groups is a list of groups based on a node\u0026rsquo;s designated role. Each node\u0026rsquo;s role is specified in the HSM database. For example, to target all of the nodes with a \u0026ldquo;Compute\u0026rdquo; role, \u0026ldquo;Compute\u0026rdquo; would need to be specified in the \u0026quot;node_role_groups\u0026quot; value.\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_roles_groups\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Compute\u0026#34;] The following roles are defined in the HSM database:\n Compute Service System Application Storage Management    "

	"content": "BOS Sessions Overview of BOS Session operations and limitations.\nThe Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) creates a session when it is asked to perform one of these operations:\n Boot - Boot a designated collection of nodes. Shutdown - Shutdown a designated collection of nodes. Reboot - Reboot a designated collection of nodes. Configure - Configure a designated collection of booted nodes.  BOS sessions can be used to boot compute nodes with customized image roots.\nThe Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) implements each session and sees it through to completion. A BOA is a Kubernetes job. It runs once to completion. If there are transient failures, BOA will exit and Kubernetes will reschedule it so that it can re-execute its session.\nA session requires two parameters, a session template ID and an operation to perform on that template. The BOS API\u0026rsquo;s session endpoint can display a list of all of the sessions that have been created, including previous and currently running sessions. The endpoint can also display the details of a given session when the specific session ID is provided as a parameter. Sessions can also be deleted through the API.\nBOS supports a RESTful API. This API can be interacted with directly using tools like cURL. It can also be interacted with through the Cray Command Line Interface (CLI). See Manage a BOS Session for more information.\nBOA Functionality in Release 1.5 In release 1.5, BOA moves nodes towards the requested state, but if a node fails during any of the immediate steps, it takes note of it. BOA will then provide a command in the output of the BOA log that can be used to retry the action. This behavior impacts all BOS operations.\nA good example would be if there is a 6,000 node system and 3 nodes fail to power off during a BOS operation. BOA will continue and attempt to re-provision the remaining 5,997 nodes. After the command is finished, it will provide output information about what the administrator needs to do to retry the last 3 nodes that failed.\nCurrent BOS Session Limitations The following limitations currently exist with BOS sessions:\n No checking is done to prevent the launch of multiple sessions with overlapping lists of nodes. Concurrently running sessions may conflict with each other. The boot ordinal and shutdown ordinal are not honored. The partition parameter is not honored. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) has its own limitations. Refer to the CFS documentation for more information.  "

	"content": "Tools for Resolving Compute Node Boot Issues A number of tools can be used to analyze and debug issues encountered during the compute node boot process. The underlying issue and symptoms dictate the type of tool required.\nnmap Use nmap to send out DHCP Discover requests to test DHCP. nmap can be installed using the following command:\nncn-m001# zypper install nmap To reach the DHCP server, the request generally needs to be sent over the Node Management network (NMN) from the non-compute node (NCN).\nIn the following example, nmap is used to send a broadcast request over the eth1 interface:\nncn-m001# nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover -e eth1 Wireshark Use Wireshark to display network traffic. It has powerful display filters that help find information that can be used for debugging. To learn more, visit https://www.wireshark.org\ntcpdump Use tcpdump to capture network traffic, such as DHCP or TFTP requests. It can be installed using the following mechanisms:\n  Install tcpdump inside an Alpine-based pod:\nalpine_pod# apk add --no-cache tcpdump   Install tcpdump on an NCN or some other node that is running SUSE:\nncn-m001# zypper install tcpdump   Invoking tcpdump without any arguments will write all of its output to stdout. This is reasonable for some tasks, but the volume of traffic that tcpdump can capture is large, so it is often better to write the output to a file.\nUse the following command to send tcpdump output to stdout:\npod# tcpdump Use the following command to send tcpdump output to a file, such as a filed named tcpdump.output in the following example:\npod# tcpdump -w /tmp/tcpdump.output Use either tcpdump or Wireshark to read from the tcpdump file. Here is how to read the file using tcpdump:\npod# tcpdump -r /tmp/tcpdump.output Filtering the traffic using tcpdump filters is not recommended because when a TFTP server answers a client they will usually use an ephemeral port that the user may not be able to identify and will not be captured by tcpdump. It is better to capture everything with tcpdump and then filter with Wireshark when looking at the resulting output. Filtering on DHCP traffic can be performed because that uses ports 67 and 68 specifically.\nTFTP Client Use a TFTP client to send TFTP requests to the TFTP server. This will test that the server is functional.

Gigabyte hardware treats power off and power on requests as successful, regardless of if actually successfully completed. The power on/off requests are ignored by Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) if they are received within a short period of time, which is typically around 60 seconds per operation.\nThe work around for customers with Gigabyte BMC hardware is to manually serialize power off events. This is done to prevent frequent power actions from being attempted and ignored by CAPMC. From a boot orchestration perspective, this can be effectively worked around by issuing CAPMC power off commands before issuing BOS reboot commands.\n"

	"content": "Healthy Compute Node Boot Process In order to investigate node boot-related issues, it is important to understand the flow of a healthy boot process and the associated components. This section outlines the normal flow of components that play a role in booting compute nodes, including DHCP, BSS, and TPTP.\nDHCP A healthy DHCP exchange between server and client looks like the following:\n   Traffic Description Sender     DHCP Discover A broadcast request from the client requesting an IP address. The request contains the client\u0026rsquo;s MAC address. Client   DHCP Offer The server offers an IP address to the client. Server   DHCP Request After testing the IP address to see that it is not in use, the client requests the proffered IP address. Client   DHCP ACK The server acknowledges that the client owns the lease on the IP address. Server    The following figure shows what a healthy DHCP discover process looks like via Wireshark, which is a packet analyzer:\nThe DHCP client uses port 68, whereas the DHCP server uses port 67. Unlike most Kubernetes pods, the DHCP pod is located on the host network.\nTFTP A healthy TFTP exchange between server and client looks like the following.\n   Traffic Description Sender     Read Request File: filename tsize=0 The client requests a file with a tsize equal to zero. Client   Option Acknowledgement The server acknowledges the request and provides the file\u0026rsquo;s size and block transfer size. Server   Error Code, Code: Option negotiation failed, Message: User aborted the transfer The client aborts the transfer once it determines the file size. Client   Read Request File: filename The client requests the file again. Client   Option Acknowledgement The server acknowledges the request and provides the block transfer size. Server   Acknowledgement, Block: 0 The client acknowledges the server. Client   Data Packet, Block: 1 The server sends the first data packet. Server   Acknowledgement, Block: 1 The client acknowledges reception of block 1. Client    The last two steps repeat until the file transfer is complete. The last block from the server will be labeled as (Last). The TFTP server listens on port 69. Kubernetes forwards port 69 on every node in the Kubernetes cluster to the TFTP pod.\nBoot Script Service (BSS) A healthy transaction with the Boot Script Service (BSS) looks similar to the following:\nncn-m001# cray bss bootscript list --mac a4:bf:01:3e:c0:a2 Example output:\n#!ipxe kernel --name kernel http://rgw.local:8080/boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/kernel?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=5RN45WD0L8KY8W4317WP%2F20200326%2Fdefault%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20200326T185958Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=43f5b0c5909ee51dabc564d2b72401983ff8fd03cc6fc309b04cb16e67f1989d initrd=initrd console=ttyS0,115200 bad_page=panic crashkernel=360M hugepagelist=2m-2g intel_iommu=off intel_pstate=disable iommu=pt ip=dhcp numa_interleave_omit=headless numa_zonelist_order=node oops=panic pageblock_order=14 pcie_ports=native printk.synchronous=y rd.neednet=1 rd.retry=10 rd.shell k8s_gw=api-gw-service-nmn.local quiet turbo_boost_limit=999 root=craycps-s3:s3://boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/rootfs:8c274aecef9e1668a8a44e8cfc2b24b5-165:dvs:api-gw-service-nmn.local:300:eth0 xname=x3000c0s17b4n0 nid=4 || goto boot_retry initrd --name initrd http://rgw.local:8080/boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/initrd?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=5RN45WD0L8KY8W4317WP%2F20200326%2Fdefault%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20200326T185958Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=d18f8da89108b9f2e659d7bbefcd106d5f13703a59f8ca837bcbc5938a9f9cc5 || goto boot_retry boot || goto boot_retry :boot_retry sleep 30 chain https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?mac=a4:bf:01:3e:f9:28\u0026amp;retry=1 "

	"content": "Kernel Boot Parameters The Image Management Service (IMS) extracts kernel boot parameters from the /boot/kernel-parameters file in the image, if that file exists, and stores them in S3. IMS already stores the other boot artifacts (kernel, initrd, and rootfs) in S3. When told to boot an image, the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) will extract these parameters and deliver them to the Boot Script Service (BSS) so they can be used during the next boot of a node.\nThere are two benefits to having kernel boot parameters extracted from the image. First, these parameters can be tightly coupled to the image. Second, these parameters do not need to be specified in the BOS session template, making the template shorter, cleaner, and less error prone.\nThe kernel boot parameters obtained from the image can be overridden by specifying the same parameters in the BOS session template. BOS supplies these parameters to the kernel in a deliberate order that causes the parameters obtained from the image to be overridden by those obtained from the session template.\nThe following is a simplified kernel boot parameter ordering:\n\u0026lt;Image parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Session template parameters\u0026gt; If there are competing values, the ones earlier in the boot string are superseded by the ones appearing later in the string.\nThe actual contents of the boot parameters are not as simple as previously described. For completeness, the following is the entire kernel boot parameter ordering:\n\u0026lt;Image parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Session template parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rootfs parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rootfs passthrough parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BOS session id\u0026gt; "

	"content": "Limit the Scope of a BOS Session The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) supports an optional \u0026ndash;limit parameter when creating a session. This parameter can be used to further limit the nodes that BOS runs against, and is applied to all boot sets.\nThe --limit parameter takes a comma-separated list of nodes, groups, or roles in any combination. The BOS session will be limited to run against components that match both the boot set information and one or more of the nodes, groups, or roles listed in the limit.\nThe table below describes the operations that can be used to further limit the scope of a BOS session. Components are treated as OR operations unless preceded by one of the operations listed in the following table.\n   Operation Description     \u0026amp; Added to the beginning of a group or role to specify an intersection of groups.   !

	"content": "Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Duplicate Address Warnings and Declined DHCP Offers in Logs If the DHCP and node logs show duplicate address warnings and indicate declined DHCP offers, it may be because another component owns the IP address that DHCP is trying to assign to a node. If this happens, the node will not accept the IP address and will repeatedly submit a DHCP discover request. As a result, the node and DHCP become entangled in a loop of requesting and rejecting. This often happens when DHCP is statically assigning IP addresses to nodes, but the assigned IP address for a node has already been assigned to another component.\nSymptoms This scenario results in node logs similar to the following:\nNode log:\n[ 97.946332] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying [ 97.789015] dracut-initqueue[604]: dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. \\ retrying [ 108.007243] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying [ 107.873650] dracut-initqueue[604]: dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. \\ retrying [ 110.082877] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying DHCP log:\nAbandoning IP address 10.100.160.195: declined.

Notice that two different components (identifiable by the two different MAC addresses a4:bf:01:29:92:eb and a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c) have made DHCP requests for the IP address 10.100.160.195.\na4:bf:01:29:92:eb is the component that owns the IP address 10.100.160.195, while a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c has been statically assigned the IP address 10.100.160.195 in the DHCP configuration file. As such, DHCP keeps trying to assign it that address, but after being offered the address, a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c declines it because it realizes that a4:bf:01:29:92:eb already owns it.\nProblem Detection There are multiple ways to check if this problem exists:\n  Ping the IP address and see if another component responds. Log into the component and determine its IP address. If it is the same as the IP address that DHCP is attempting to assign, then this issue does exist.\n  Check the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache using the arp command. Because it is a cache, it is possible that IP addresses can age out of the cache, so the IP address may not be present. If the address that is failing to be assigned is in the ARP cache, and it is assigned to a node with a different MAC address, then that is confirmation that this problem has occurred.\nncn-m001# arp Example output:\nAddress HWtype HWaddress Flags Mask Iface ncn-w002.local ether 98:03:9b:b4:f1:fe C bond0.nmn0 10.46.11.201 ether ca:d3:dc:33:29:e7 C weave 10.46.12.7 ether 7e:7e:7f:f0:0d:2d C weave 10.46.11.197 ether 62:4c:91:91:ec:9f C weave 10.46.11.193 ether 52:dd:02:01:34:ab C weave 10.32.0.5 ether ba:ff:65:af:a7:4e C weave 10.46.11.191 ether be:36:79:07:84:08 C weave 10.45.1.121 ether fe:93:50:63:9a:fd C weave 10.46.11.187 ether e6:2e:8c:ed:f8:78 C weave 10.46.11.250 ether c6:73:6d:c4:b9:77 C weave 10.48.15.0 ether da:c2:40:ed:f4:ec CM flannel.2 [...]   Resolution Force the component that has been assigned an incorrect IP address to request another one.

The default values are shown below:\n- name: \u0026#34;NODE_STATE_CHECK_NUMBER_OF_RETRIES\u0026#34; value: \u0026#34;120\u0026#34; - name: \u0026#34;NODE_STATE_CHECK_SLEEP_INTERVAL\u0026#34; value: \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; The example below increases the number of retries to 360, which results in a timeout of 1800 seconds or 30 minutes if the sleep interval is not changed from the default value of 5 seconds. Different values might be needed depending on system size.\nAdd the following values to the ConfigMap:\n- name: \u0026#34;NODE_STATE_CHECK_NUMBER_OF_RETRIES\u0026#34; value: \u0026#34;360\u0026#34; The new variables need to be placed under the environment (env:) section in the ConfigMap.

	"content": "Boot Orchestration The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. This is accomplished using BOS components, such as boot orchestration session templates and sessions, as well as launching a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) that fulfills boot requests.\nBOS users create a BOS session template via the REST API. A session template is a collection of metadata for a group of nodes and their desired boot artifacts and configuration. A BOS session can then be created by applying an action to a session template. The available actions are boot, reboot, shutdown, and configure. BOS will create a Kubernetes BOA job to apply an action. BOA coordinates with the underlying subsystems to complete the action requested. The session can be monitored to determine the status of the request.\nBOS depends on each of the following services to complete its tasks:\n BOA - Handles any action type submitted to the BOS API. BOA jobs are created and launched by BOS. Boot Script Service (BSS) - Stores the configuration information that is used to boot each hardware component. Nodes consult BSS for their boot artifacts and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) - BOA launches CFS to apply configuration to the nodes in its boot sets (node personalization). Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) - Used to power on and off the nodes. Hardware State Manager (HSM) - Tracks the state of each node and what groups and roles nodes are included in.  Use the BOS Cray CLI Commands BOS utilizes the Cray CLI commands. The latest API information can be found with the following command:\nncn-m001# cray bos list Example output:\n[[results]] major = \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; minor = \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; patch = \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; [[results.links]] href = \u0026quot;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bos/v1\u0026quot; rel = \u0026quot;self\u0026quot; BOS API Changes in Upcoming CSM-1.2.0 Release This is a forewarning of changes that will be made to the BOS API in the upcoming CSM-1.2.0 release. The following changes will be made:\n The --template-body option for the Cray CLI bos command will be deprecated. Performing a GET on the session status for a boot set (i.e. /v1/session/{session_id}/status/{boot_set_name}) currently returns a status code of 201, but instead it should return a status code of 200. This will be corrected to return 200.  "

	"content": "Clean Up After a BOS/BOA Job is Completed or Cancelled When a BOS session is created, there are a number of items created on the system. When a session is cancelled or completed, these items need to be cleaned up to ensure there is not lingering content from the session on the system.\nWhen a session is launched, the items below are created:\n Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) job: The Kubernetes job that runs and handles the BOS session. ConfigMap for BOA: This ConfigMap contains the configuration information that the BOA job uses. The BOA pod mounts a ConfigMap named boot-session at /mnt/boot_session inside the pod. This ConfigMap has a random UUID name, such as e786def5-37a6-40db-b36b-6b67ebe174ee. This name does not obviously connect it to the BOA job. etcd entries: BOS makes an entry for the session in its etcd key/value store. If the BOA job has run for long enough, it will also have written a status entry into etcd for this session. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) session: If configuration is enabled, and the session is doing a boot, reboot, or configure operation, then BOA will have instructed CFS to configure the nodes once they boot. There is not an easy way to link a BOA session to the CFS sessions that are spawned.  Prerequisites  A Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session has been completed or cancelled. The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system.  Procedure   Identify the BOA job that needs to be deleted.\nDescribe the BOS session to find the name of the BOA job under the attribute boa_job_name.\nncn-m001# cray bos session describe --format json BOS_SESSION_ID Example output:\n{ \u0026quot;status_link\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/v1/session/d200f7e4-1a9f-4466-9ef4-30add3bd87dd/status\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;start_time\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-08-11 21:02:09.137917\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;templateUuid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cle-1.3.0-nid1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;error_count\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;boa_job_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boa-d200f7e4-1a9f-4466-9ef4-30add3bd87dd\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;in_progress\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;operation\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boot\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;stop_time\u0026quot;: null }   Find the ConfigMap for the BOA job.\nThe ConfigMap is listed as boot-session under the Volumes section. Retrieve the Name value from the returned output.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services describe job BOA_JOB_NAME Example output:\n[...] Volumes: boot-session: Type: ConfigMap (a volume populated by a ConfigMap) **Name: e786def5-37a6-40db-b36b-6b67ebe174ee** Optional: false   Delete the ConfigMap.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services delete cm CONFIGMAP_NAME   Delete the etcd entry for the BOS session.\nncn-m001# cray bos session delete BOS_SESSION_ID   Stop CFS from configuring nodes.\nThere are several different use cases covered in this step. The process varies depending on whether a job is being cancelled, or if the CFS content is simply being cleaned up.\nIn the BOS session template, if configuration is enabled, BOA instructs the nodes to configure on boot when doing a boot or reboot operation. When only doing a configure operation, the configuration happens right away. If configuration is disabled or the operation is shutdown, then BOA will not instruct CFS to configure the nodes, and nothing further needs to be done. The remainder of this step may be skipped.\nIf BOA instructs CFS to configure the nodes, then CFS will set the desired configuration for the nodes in its database. Once BOA tells CFS to configure the nodes, which happens early in the BOA job, then CFS will configure the nodes immediately if the operation is configure, or upon the node booting if the operation is boot or reboot.\nAttempting to prevent CFS from configuring the nodes is a multi-step, tedious process. It may be simpler to allow CFS to configure the nodes. If the nodes are going to be immediately rebooted, then the CFS configuration will be rerun once the nodes have booted, thus undoing any previous configuration. Alternately, if the nodes are going to be immediately shutdown, this will remove any need to prevent CFS from configuring the nodes.\nFollow the procedures for one of the following use cases:\n  Configuration has completed and the sessions need to be cleaned up the to reduce clutter:\n  Find the old sessions that needs to be deleted.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list   Delete the sessions.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions delete CFS_SESSION_NAME     Configuration has completed and the desired state needs to be cleaned up so that configuration does not happen on restart:\n  Unset the desired state for all components affected.\nTo find the impacted component names (xnames) for the components with the desired configuration matching what was applied:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components list Prevent the configuration from running:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components update XNAME --desired-state-commit This needs to be done for each component. It is enough to prevent configuration from running, and it does not revert to the previous desired state. The previous desired state has already been overwritten at this point, so if the user is trying to completely revert, they will either need to know and apply the previous desired state manually, or return BOS with the previous template using the configure operation (which may also trigger a configure operation).\n    Configuration was set/started and needs to be cancelled:\n  Unset the desired state for all components affected.\nTo find the impacted component names (xnames) for the components with the desired configuration matching what was applied:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components list Prevent the configuration from running:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components update XNAME --desired-state-commit This needs to be done for each component. It is enough to prevent configuration from running, and it does not revert to the previous desired state. The previous desired state has already been overwritten at this point, so if the user is trying to completely revert, they will either need to know and apply the previous desired state manually, or return BOS with the previous template using the configure operation (which may also trigger a configure operation).\n  Restart the batcher.\nThis will purge any information that CFS cached in relation to the BOA job that it was intending to act upon.\nTo get the cfs-batcher pod ID:\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services get pods|grep cray-cfs-batcher Example output:\ncray-cfs-batcher-644599c6cc-rwl8f 2/2 Running 0 6d17h To restart the pod, scale the replicas to 0 to stop it, and back up to 1 to restart it:\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services scale CFS-BATCHER_POD_ID --replicas=0 ncn-m001# kubectl -n services scale CFS-BATCHER_POD_ID --replicas=1   Find the existing session that needs to be deleted.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list   Delete the sessions.\nThis step must be done after restarting cfs-batcher. If the cached information is not purged from Batcher first, then Batcher may start additional CFS sessions in response to them being killed. The Batcher agent would fight against the user if it is not restarted.\nUnfortunately, it is hard to link a specific BOA session to a CFS session. At this time, they are identified by comparing the CFS timestamps with those of the BOA job, and associating them based on proximity. Additionally, examine the components in the CFS job to see that they match the components in the BOA job.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions delete CFS_SESSION_NAME       Delete the BOA job.\nThe BOA job is not deleted right away because it is needed to find the ConfigMap name.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services delete job BOA_JOB_NAME   "

The RESTful API that Ceph provides via the gateway is compatible with the basic data access model of the Amazon S3 API. See the https://docs.ceph.com/en/pacific/radosgw/s3/ for more information about compatibility. The object gateway is also referred to as the RADOS gateway or simply RGW.\nS3 is an object storage service that provides high-level performance, scalability, security, and data availability. S3 exposes a rudimentary data model, similar to a file system, where buckets (directories) store objects (files). Bucket- and object-level Access Control Lists (ACL) can be provided for flexible access authorization to artifacts stored in S3.\nRGW on HPE Cray EX Systems RGW is installed as a part of the HPE Cray EX Stage 3 deployment. The S3 API is available on systems at the following location:\nhttps://rgw-vip.local The RGW administrative interface (radosgw-admin) is available on non-compute nodes (NCNs).\n"

	"content": "BOS Workflows The following workflows present a high-level overview of common Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) operations. These workflows depict how services interact with each other when booting, configuring, or shutting down nodes. They also help provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nThe following workflows are included in this section:\n Boot and Configure Nodes Reconfigure Nodes Power Off Nodes  Boot and Configure Nodes Use Case: Administrator powers on and configures select compute nodes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the BOS with other services during the boot process:\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. The Boot Orchestration Service has the following components:  Boot Orchestration Session Template is a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and parameters. Boot Orchestration Session carries out an operation. The possible operations in a session are boot, shutdown, reboot, and configure. Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) is automatically launched to execute the session. A BOA executes the given operation, and if the operation is a boot or a reboot, it also configures the nodes post-boot (if configure is enabled).   Cray Advanced Platform and Monitoring Control (CAPMC) service provides system-level power control for nodes in the system. CAPMC interfaces directly with the Redfish APIs to the controller infrastructure to effect power and environmental changes on the system. Hardware State Manager (HSM) tracks the state of each node and their group and role associations. Boot Script Service (BSS) stores per-node information about iPXE boot script. Nodes consult BSS for boot artifacts (kernel, initrd, image root) and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores boot artifacts. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configures nodes using configuration framework. Launches and aggregates the status from one or more Ansible instances against nodes (node personalization) or images (image customization).

	"content": "Manage Artifacts with the Cray CLI The artifacts (objects) available for use on the system are created and managed with the Cray CLI. The cray artifacts command provides the ability to manage any given artifact. The Cray CLI automatically authenticates users and provides Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials.\nAll operations with the cray artifacts command assume that the user has already been authenticated. If the user has not been authenticated with the Cray CLI, run the following command:\nncn# cray auth login Enter the appropriate credentials when prompted:\nUsername: adminuser Password: Success! will be returned if the user is successfully authenticated.\nAuthorization is Local to a Host: whenever you are using the CLI (cray command) on a host (e.g. a workstation or NCN) where it has not been used before, it is necessary to authenticate on that host using cray auth login. There is no mechanism to distribute CLI authorization amongst hosts.\nView S3 Buckets There are several S3 buckets available that can be used to upload and download files with the cray artifacts command.

This is useful for organizing objects within a bucket, but S3 treats it as a name only. No directory structure exists.\nWhen interacting with Cray services, use the artifact value returned by the cray artifacts create command. This will ensure that Cray services can access the uploaded object.\nDownload Artifacts Artifacts are downloaded with the cray artifacts get command. Provide the object name, the bucket, and a file path to download the artifact in order to use this command.\nncn# cray artifacts get S3_BUCKET S3_OBJECT_KEY DOWNLOAD_FILEPATH For example:\nncn# cray artifacts get boot-images 5c5b6ae5-64da-4212-887a-301087a17099 /path/to/downloads/dl-repo.tgz No output is shown unless an error occurs.\nDelete Artifacts Artifacts are removed from buckets with the cray artifacts delete command.

In the case of Legacy Mode UAI creation without a default UAI Class, all configured volumes are used when creating UAIs. This can be controlled more precisely by defining and using UAI Classes. There is more information on Kubernetes volumes in the Kubernetes Documentation.\nNOTE: As with UAI images, registering a volume with UAS creates the configuration that will be used to create a UAI. If the underlying object referred to by the volume does not exist at the time the UAI is created, the UAI will, in most cases, wait until the object becomes available before starting up. This will be visible in the UAI state which will eventually move to waiting.\nNext Topic: List Volumes Registered in UAS\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: UAI Network Attachment Customization\nUAI macvlans Network Attachments UAIs need to be able to reach compute nodes across the HPE Cray EX internal networks. When the compute node networks are structured as multiple subnets, this requires routing from the UAIs to those subnets. The default route in a UAI goes to the public network through the Customer Access Network (CAN) so that will not work for reaching compute nodes. To solve this problem, UAS installs Kubernetes Network Attachments within the Kubernetes user namespace. One of these network attachments is used by UAIs.\nThe type of network attachment used on HPE Cray EX hardware for this purpose is a macvlan network attachment, so this is often referred to on HPE Cray EX systems as \u0026ldquo;macvlans\u0026rdquo;. This network attachment integrates the UAI into the HPE Cray EX internal networks on the UAI host node where the UAI is running and assigns the UAI an IP address on the network defined by the network attachment. The network attachment also installs a set of routes in the UAI used to reach the compute nodes in the HPE Cray EX platform.\nNext Topic: UAI Network Attachment Customization\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Troubleshoot UAS Issues\nUAS and UAI Legacy Mode Health Checks Check the health of UAS and UAI to validate installation / upgrade of an HPE Cray EX system. This is a legacy mode procedure that can be run at installation / upgrade time to make sure that the following are true:\n UAS is installed and running correctly UAI images are installed and registered correctly UAIs can be created in legacy mode  Initialize and Authorize the CLI The procedures below use the CLI as an authorized user and run on two separate node types. The first part runs on the LiveCD node while the second part runs on a non-LiveCD Kubernetes master or worker node. When using the CLI on either node, the CLI configuration must be initialized and the user running the procedure must be authorized. This section describes how to initialize the CLI for use by a user and authorize the CLI as a user to run the procedures on any given node. The procedures will need to be repeated in both stages of the validation procedure.\nDiscontinue Use of the CRAY_CREDENTIALS Service Account Token Installation procedures leading up to production mode on Shasta use the CLI with a Kubernetes managed service account normally used for internal operations. There is a procedure for extracting the OAUTH token for this service account and assigning it to the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable to permit simple CLI operations. The UAS / UAI validation procedure runs as a post-installation procedure and requires an actual user with Linux credentials, not this service account. Prior to running any of the steps below you must unset the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable.\nncn-m002# unset CRAY_CREDENTIALS Initialize the CLI Configuration The CLI needs to know what host to use to obtain authorization and what user is requesting authorization so it can obtain an OAUTH token to talk to the API Gateway. This is accomplished by initializing the CLI configuration. This example uses the vers username. In practice, vers and the response to the password: prompt should be replaced with the username and password of the administrator running the validation procedure.\nTo check whether the CLI needs initialization, run the following command.\nncn-m002# cray config describe If the output appears as follows, the CLI requires initialization.\nUsage: cray config describe [OPTIONS] Error: No configuration exists. Run `cray init` If the output appears more like the following, then the CLI is initialized and logged in as vers. If that is the incorrect username, authorize the correct username and password in the next section. If vers is the correct user, proceed to the validation procedure on that node.\nIf the CLI must be initialized again, use the following command and include the correct username, password, and the password response.\nncn-m002# cray init Cray Hostname: api-gw-service-nmn.local Username: vers Password: Success! Initialization complete. Authorize the Correct CLI User If the CLI is initialized but authorized for a user different, run the following command and substitute the correct username and password.\nncn-m002# cray auth login Username: vers Password: Success! Authorization Is Local to a Host: whenever you are using the CLI (cray command) on a host (e.g. a workstation or NCN) where it has not been used before, it is necessary to authenticate on that host using cray auth login. There is no mechanism to distribute CLI authorization amongst hosts.\nTroubleshoot CLI Initialization or Authorization Issues If initialization or authorization fails in any of the preceding steps, there are several common causes.\n DNS failure looking up api-gw-service-nmn.local may be preventing the CLI from reaching the API Gateway and Keycloak for authorization Network connectivity issues with the NMN may be preventing the CLI from reaching the API Gateway and Keycloak for authorization Certificate mismatch or trust issues may be preventing a secure connection to the API Gateway Istio failures may be preventing traffic from reaching Keycloak Keycloak may not yet be set up to authorize you as a user  While resolving these issues is beyond the scope of this section, adding -vvvvv to the cray auth or cray init commands may offer clues as to why the initialization or authorization is failing.\nValidate the Basic UAS Installation This procedure and the following procedures run on separate nodes on the system and validate the basic UAS installation. Ensure this runs on the LiveCD node and that the CLI is authorized for the user.\nncn-m002# cray uas mgr-info list Example output:\nservice_name = \u0026quot;cray-uas-mgr\u0026quot; version = \u0026quot;1.11.5\u0026quot; ncn-m001-pit# cray uas list Example output:\nresults = [] This shows that UAS is installed and running version 1.11.5 and that no UAIs are running. If another user has been using the UAS, it is possible to see UAIs in the list. That is acceptable from a validation standpoint.\nTo verify that the pre-made UAI images are registered with UAS, run the following command.\nncn-m002# cray uas images list Example output:\ndefault_image = \u0026quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot; image_list = [ \u0026quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot;,] The output shows that the pre-made End-User UAI image, cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest, is registered with UAS. This does not necessarily mean this image is installed in the container image registry, but it is configured for use. If other UAI images have been created and registered, they may also appear in the output.\nValidate UAI Creation The following are needed for this procedure:\n Must run on a master or worker node (and not ncn-w001). Must run on the HPE Cray EX system (or from an external host, but the procedure for that is not covered here). Requires that the CLI be initialized and authorized as for the current user.    Verify that the user account can create a UAI.\nncn-w003# cray uas create --publickey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Example output:\nuai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w001\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;10.16.234.10\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Pending\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;vers\u0026quot; [uai_portmap] The UAI is now created and in the process of initializing and running.\n  View the state of the UAI.\nThe following can be repeated as many times as desired. If the results appear like the following, the UAI is ready for use.\nncn-w003# cray uas list Example output:\n[[results]] uai_age = \u0026quot;0m\u0026quot; uai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w001\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;10.16.234.10\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Running: Ready\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;vers\u0026quot;   Log into the UAI (without a password) as follows:\n  SSH to the UAI.\nncn-w003# ssh vers@10.16.234.10 Example output:\nThe authenticity of host '10.16.234.10 (10.16.234.10)' can't be established.

	"content": "Next Topic: UAS Limitations\nUser Access Service (UAS) The User Access Service (UAS) is a service that manages User Access Instances (UAIs) which are containerized services under Kubernetes that provide application developers and users with a lightweight login environment in which to create and run user applications. UAIs run on non-compute nodes (NCN), specifically Kubernetes Worker nodes.\nAt a high level, there are two ways to configure UAS with respect to allowing users access to UAIs. The standard configuration involves the use of Broker UAIs through which users establish SSH login sessions. When a login session is established to a Broker UAI the Broker UAI either locates or creates a new UAI on behalf of the user and forwards the user\u0026rsquo;s SSH connection to that UAI. A legacy configuration requires users to create their own UAIs through the cray CLI. Once a UAI is created in this way, the users can use SSH to log into the UAI directly. The legacy configuration will soon be deprecated. Sites using it should migrate to the Broker UAI based configuration.\nOnce logged into a UAI, users can use most of the facilities found on a User Access Node (UAN) with certain limitations. Users can also use UAIs to transfer data between the Cray system and external systems.\nBy default, the timezone inside the UAI container is configured to match the timezone on the host NCN on which it is running, For example, if the timezone on the host NCN is set to CDT, the UAIs on that host will also be set to CDT.\n   Component Function/Description     User Access Instance (UAI) An instance of UAS container.   cray-uas-mgr Manages UAI life cycles.       Container Element Components     Operating system SLES15 SP2   kubectl command Utility to interact with Kubernetes.   cray command Command that allows users to create, describe, and delete UAIs.    Administrative users use cray uas admin uais list to list the following parameters for all existing UAIs:\nNote: The example values below are used throughout the UAS procedures. They are used as examples only. Users should substitute with site-specific values.\n   Parameter Description Example value     uai_connect_string The UAI connection string ssh user@203.0.113.0 -i ~/.ssh/id\\_rsa   uai_img The UAI image ID registry.local/cray/cray-uas-sles15sp1-slurm:latest   uai_name The UAI name uai-user-be3a6770   uai_status The state of the UAI. Running: Ready   username The user who created the UAI. user   uai_age The age of the UAI. 11m   uai_host The node hosting the UAI. ncn-w001    Authorized users in Legacy UAI Management use cray uas list to see the same information on all existing UAIs owned by the user (if any).\nGetting started UAS is highly configurable and it is recommended that administrators familiarize themselves with, at least, the major concepts covered in the Table of Contents below before allowing users to use UAIs. In particular, the concepts of End-User UAIs and Broker UAIs, and the procedures for setting up and customizing Broker UAIs are critical to setting up UAS properly.\nAnother important topic, once administrators are familiar with setting up UAS to provide basic UAIs, is customizing the UAI image to support user workflows. At the simplest level, administrators will want to create and use a UAI image that matches the booted compute nodes. This can be done by following the Customize End-User UAI Images procedure.\nTable of Contents  UAS Limitations List UAS Version Information End-User UAIs Special Purpose UAIs Elements of a UAI UAI Host Nodes UAI Host Node Selection UAI macvlans Network Attachments UAI Network Attachment Customization Configure UAIs in UAS  UAI Images  Listing Registered UAI Images Register a UAI Image Retrieve UAI Image Registration Information Update a UAI Image Registration Delete a UAI Image Registration   Volumes  List Volumes Registered in UAS Add a Volume to UAS Obtain Configuration of a UAS Volume Update a UAS Volume Delete a Volume Configuration   Resource Specifications  List UAI Resource Specifications Create a UAI Resource Specification Retrieve Resource Specification Details Update a Resource Specification Delete a UAI Resource Specification   UAI Classes  List Available UAI Classes Create a UAI Class View a UAI Class Modify a UAI Class Delete a UAI Class     UAI Management  List UAIs Creating a UAI Examining a UAI Using a Direct Administrative Command Deleting a UAI   Common UAI Configurations  Choosing UAI Resource Settings Setting End-User UAI Timeouts Broker UAI Resiliency and Load Balancing   Broker Mode UAI Management  Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode Configure a Broker UAI class Start a Broker UAI Log in to a Broker UAI   UAI Image Customization  Customize the Broker UAI Image Customize End-User UAI Images   Legacy Mode User-Driven UAI Management  Configure A Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode Create and Use Default UAIs in Legacy Mode List Available UAI Images in Legacy Mode Create UAIs From Specific UAI Images in Legacy Mode UAS and UAI Legacy Mode Health Checks   Troubleshoot UAS Issues  Troubleshoot UAS by Viewing Log Output Troubleshoot UAIs by Viewing Log Output Troubleshoot Stale Brokered UAIs Troubleshoot UAI Stuck in \u0026ldquo;ContainerCreating\u0026rdquo; Troubleshoot Duplicate Mount Paths in a UAI Troubleshoot Missing or Incorrect UAI Images Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Troubleshoot Common Mistakes when Creating a Custom End-User UAI Image Troubleshoot UAS / CLI Authentication Issues Troubleshoot Broker UAI SSSD Cannot Use /etc/sssd/sssd.conf   Clear UAS Configuration  Next Topic: UAS Limitations\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: List Available UAI Classes\nUAI Classes UAI Classes provide templates for the creation of UAIs. They permit precise configuration of the behavior, volumes, resources, and other elements of the UAI. When a UAI is created using a UAI Class, it is configured to use exactly what that UAI Class has in it at the time the UAI was created. UIA Classes permit Broker UAIs to create different kinds of UAIs based on the UAI Creation Class setting of the Broker UAI. UAI Classes also provide the foundation on which Broker UAIs are built, defining specific configuration options without which it would not be possible to construct a Broker UAI.\nIn the Legacy UAI Creation mode, default UAI classes allow the precise configuration of user-created UAIs. This is particularly useful with regard to volumes, since, without a default UAI Class, all user-created UAIs would simply try to attach all configured volumes. Finally, default UAI Classes enable the Legacy UAI Creation mode to access Resource Specifications and other configuration not normally available to user-created UAIs.\nThis topic describes the content and purpose of the the fields in a UAI Class and gives guidance on setting those when creating UAI classes or various kinds.\nExample Listing and Overview The following is JSON-formatted example output from the cray uas admin config classes list command (see List Available UAI Classes).

This identifier is also used to create UAIs using this class with the cray uas admin uais create, and by Broker UAI Classes to specify what kind of End-User UAIs to create using the uai_creation_class field of the Broker UAI Class   comment A free-form string describing the UAI class     default A boolean value (flag) indicating whether this class is the default class. When this field is set to true, this class overrides both the default UAI image and any specified image name when the cray uas create command is used to create an End-User UAI for a user. Setting a class to \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: true, gives the administrator fine-grained control over the behavior of End-User UAIs that are created by authorized users in legacy mode.   namespace The Kubernetes namespace in which this UAI will run. The default setting is user. Broker UAIs should be configured to run in the uas namespace   opt_ports An optional list of TCP port numbers that will be opened on the external IP address of the UAI when it runs. This field controls whether services other than SSH can be run and reached publicly on the UAI. If this list is empty (as in this example), only SSH will be externally accessible. In order for any service other than SSH to be publicly reachable the public_ip field must be set to true   priority_class_name The Kubernetes priority class of the UAI. \u0026ldquo;uai_priority\u0026rdquo; is the default. Using other values affects both Kubernetes default resource limit and request assignments and the Kubernetes scheduling priority for the UAI.   public_ip A boolean value that indicates whether the UAI will be given an external IP address from the LoadBalancer service. Such an address enables clients outside the Kubernetes cluster to reach the UAI. This field controls whether the UAI is reachable by SSH from external clients, but it also controls whether the ports in opt_ports are reachable. If this field is set to false, the UAI will have only an internal IP address, reachable from within the Kubernetes cluster.   replicas The number of replica UAI pods to be created when a UAI of this class is created. This defaults to 1 and should not be set or should be set to 1 on End-User UAI Classes, since replica UAI pods for End-User UAIs only consume resources and potentially confuse the Broker UAI mechanism. For Broker UAI Classes, however, setting replicas to a larger value establishes both a degree of Broker UAI resiliency and a degree of load balancing, both for the purpose increasing network throughput on End-User UAI connections and for the purpose of avoiding overload of a single Broker UAI\u0026rsquo;s resources.   resource\\id The ID of the Resource Specification used by this UAI Class By configuring a Resource Specification in a UAI Class the default resource requests and limits can be overridden when creating a UAI from that UAI Class   service_account An optional Kubernetes Service Account name to be granted to UAIs using this class This is normally not set on End-User UAIs or Broker UAIs. It can be used to confer specific Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions on UAIs created using a UAI Class   timeout An optional specification of hard and soft timeouts used to control the life-cycle of UAIs created using this UAI Class If either timeout setting is omitted that timeout will never expire. When a soft timeout, expires, the UAI terminates and is removed if it is or becomes idle, defined as having no logged in user sessions. When a hard timeout expires the UAI is terminated and removed immediately regardless of logged in user sessions. A warning may also be configured, specifying the number of seconds before a hard timeout that a warning will be sent to logged in users telling them of impending termination. The example here sets a hard timeout of 24 hours, a soft timeout of 30 minutes and a warning 60 seconds prior to arriving at the hard timeout.   tolerations An optional list of Kubernetes tolerations that can be used in combination with \u0026ldquo;taints\u0026rdquo; on Kubernetes worker nodes to permit only UAIs of this class to run on those nodes. Tolerations and Taints can be used to designate certain Kubernetes Worker NCNs as hosts for UAIs and not for general management plane activities. They can also be used to specify that UAIs of a given class run only on nodes with specific resources. By default, all UAIs receive a toleration of uai_only op=Exists meaning that all UAIs can run on nodes that are tainted with a uai_only setting.   uai_compute_network A flag that indicates whether this UAI uses the macvlan mechanism to gain access to the HPE Cray EX compute node network. This field must be true to support workload management from UAIs created by this class. It should be set to false on Broker UAIs.   uai_creation_class A field used in Broker UAI Classes to tell the Broker UAI what kind of UAI to create when automatically creating a UAI. This field is not set in the preceding example.    UAI Image Descriptions, Resource Descriptions, and Volume Descriptions in UAI Classes The following image description is provided as a convenience to allow the user to see the image information used when creating UAIs of this class:\n \u0026quot;uai_image\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1996c7f7-ca45-4588-bc41-0422fe2a1c3d\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;imagename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp2:1.2.4\u0026quot; }, The following Resource Specification description is provided as a convenience to allow the user to see the resource configuration used when creating UAIs of this UAI Class:\n \u0026quot;resource_config\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;comment\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Resource Specification to use with Brokered End-User UAIs\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;limit\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{\\\u0026quot;cpu\\\u0026quot;: \\\u0026quot;1\\\u0026quot;, \\\u0026quot;memory\\\u0026quot;: \\\u0026quot;1Gi\\\u0026quot;}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;request\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{\\\u0026quot;cpu\\\u0026quot;: \\\u0026quot;1\\\u0026quot;, \\\u0026quot;memory\\\u0026quot;: \\\u0026quot;1Gi\\\u0026quot;}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;resource_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;f26ee12c-6215-4ad1-a15e-efe4232f45e6\u0026quot; }, The following list of volume descriptions is provided as a convenience to allow the user to see the specific volume configuration used when creating UAIs of this class:\n \u0026quot;volume_mounts\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/etc/localtime\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;host_path\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/etc/localtime\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;FileOrCreate\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;11a4a22a-9644-4529-9434-d296eef2dc48\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;timezone\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/lus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;host_path\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/lus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;DirectoryOrCreate\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;a3b149fd-c477-41f0-8f8d-bfcee87fdd0a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lustre\u0026quot; } ] Refer to Elements of a UAI for a full explanation of UAI images, Resource Specifications and volumes.\nIn the preceding section of output, the End-User UAI inherits the timezone from the host node by importing /etc/localtime. This UAI also gains access to the Lustre file system mounted on the host node. On the host node, the file system is mounted at /lus and the UAI mounts the file system at the same mount point as the host node.\nSpecifics of a Broker UAI Class Notice the following settings in the Broker UAI class example above:\n \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: false, ... \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;8f180ddc-37e5-4ead-b261-2b401914a79f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;namespace\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;uas\u0026quot;, ... \u0026quot;public_ip\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;replicas\u0026quot;: 3, ... \u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;: null, ... \u0026quot;uai_compute_network\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;uai_creation_class\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bdb4988b-c061-48fa-a005-34f8571b88b4\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;uai_image\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;8f180ddc-37e5-4ead-b261-2b401914a79f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;imagename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:1.2.4\u0026quot; }, Default is False Usually a site will not want or need to set a Broker UAI\u0026rsquo;s default flag to true because Broker UAIs will be administratively launched, not launched through the legacy mode UAI management procedure.\nImage ID specifies the HPE Supplied Broker UAI Image A Broker UAI runs in a special image that knows how to authenticate multiple users, find or create End-User UAIs on behalf of those users, and forward SSH connections to those End-User UAIs. HPE provides a Broker UAI image with this logic built into it.\nNamespace is uas Broker UAIs run in the uas namespace which is configured to set up pods with access to the API gateway. This is needed by Broker UAIs so that they can call UAS APIs to create, find and manage End-User UAIs.\nPublic IP is True Broker UAIs accept incoming SSH connections from external hosts, so they need to have a presence on an external network. Setting public_ip to true makes this work.\nReplicas is greater than 1 While it is not required to make the number of replicas for a Broker UAI greater than 1, setting a larger number makes the Broker UAI more resilient to node outages, resource starvation, and other possible issues. A larger replica count also reduces the networking and computational load on individual Broker UAI pods by permitting connections to be load balanced across the replicas. The replica count should not exceed the number of Kubernetes Worker Nodes permitted to host Broker UAIs.\nNo Timeout is Specified Broker UAIs cannot time out (there is no timeout mechanism in them) so setting a timeout on Broker UAIs is meaningless. Furthermore, since Broker UAIs are resources that should remain in place on a running system, putting a timeout on a Broker UAI would be counterproductive. Broker UAIs should have either no timeout specified or an empty timeout.\nUAI Compute Network is False Broker UAIs do not need access to workload management services, so they should not run with UAI Compute Network access. Setting this to true would consume IP addresses on the UAI Compute Network unnecessarily and reduce the number of End-User UAIs available on the system.\nSpecifics of a Brokered End-User UAI Class Notice the following settings in the Brokered End-User UAI Class:\n \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;8f180ddc-37e5-4ead-b261-2b401914a79f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;namespace\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;user\u0026quot;, ... \u0026quot;public_ip\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;replicas\u0026quot;: 1, ... \u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;hard\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;86400\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;soft\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1800\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;warning\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;60\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;uai_compute_network\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;uai_creation_class\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;uai_image\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;8f180ddc-37e5-4ead-b261-2b401914a79f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;imagename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:1.2.4\u0026quot; }, Default is False The UAI Class used for Brokered End-User UAIs has characteristics that do not make it suitable for use as a Non-Brokered UAI, so a Brokered UAI Class should never be the default UAI Class.\nUAI Image is an End-User UAI Image In this example, the UAI image used is the HPE provided basic End-User UAI image. This could also be a custom End-User UAI image. The important thing for any End-User UAI Class is that the image is an End-User UAI image of some kind.\nNamespace is user In this example the namespace setting is user. This is the default setting and causes UAIs created by this UAI Class to run in the user namespace. The user namespace is isolated from Kubernetes resources in other namespaces and does not set up a connection to the API Gateway for pods running inside it. This, or a similarly isolated namespace should always be used for End-User UAIs since it keeps End-User UAIs isolated from management plane activities even though they are running inside the Kubernetes cluster.\nPublic IP Is False Brokered UAIs are always reached through Broker UAIs, so they do not need to and should not expose public IP access.\nReplicas is 1 or Not Specified Using replica pods in an End-User UAI simply wastes UAI Compute Network IP addresses, thereby limiting the number of End-User UAIs that can be created. The default value of 1 should be used for replicas in all End-User UAI Classes.\nTimeout is Provided While setting a timeout on End-User UAIs is not required, it is a good idea. Stale and idle UAIs consume resources that could be used by active fresh UAIs. By setting, at least, a soft timeout on End-User UAI Classes, the administrator can ensure that resources are released to the system when a user\u0026rsquo;s UAI becomes idle for an extended time. The above timeout specification will terminate the UAI, even if it is not idle, after 24 hours, with a 60 second warning. It will terminate an idle UAI after 30 minutes.\nUAI Compute Network is True End-User UAIs generally require access to workload management, so they require access the compute node network. Setting uai_compute_network to true makes this work.\nUAI Creation Class is not specified UAI Creation Class is only meaningful to UAIs that create other UAIs (specifically Broker UAIs).\nSpecifics of a Non-Brokered End-User UAI Class Non-Brokered End-User UAIs are very similar to Brokered End-User UAIs, but Non-Brokered End-User UAIs have some special traits. Notice the specific settings in the Non-Brokered End-User UAI Class that are different from those in the Brokered End-User UAI Class:\n \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;public_ip\u0026quot;: true, Default is True The UAI Class used for Non-Brokered End-User UAIs must be the default UAI Class. There is no way to create a UAI from a class in the Legacy Mode UAI Creation procedures.\nPublic IP Is True Manually created UAIs must be reached by direct SSH from external hosts, so they need to have a presence on an external network. Setting public_ip to true makes this work.\nNext Topic: List Available UAI Classes\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: UAI macvlans Network Attachments\nUAI Host Node Selection When selecting UAI host nodes, it is a good idea to take into account the amount of combined load users and system services will bring to those nodes. UAIs run by default at a lower priority than system services on worker nodes which means that, if the combined load exceeds the capacity of the nodes, Kubernetes will eject UAIs and/or refuse to schedule them to protect system services. This can be disruptive or frustrating for users. This section explains how to identify the currently configured UAI host nodes and how to adjust that selection to meet the needs of users.\nIdentify UAI Host Nodes UAI host node identification is an exclusive activity, not an inclusive one, so it starts by identifying the nodes that could potentially be UAI host nodes by their Kubernetes role:\n Identify nodes that could potentially be UAI host nodes by their Kubernetes role.  ncn-m001-pit# kubectl get nodes | grep -v master Example output:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.20.13 ncn-w002 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 25d v1.20.13 ncn-w003 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 23d v1.20.13 In this example, there are three nodes known by Kubernetes that are not running as Kubernetes master nodes. These are all potential UAI host nodes.\nIdentify the nodes that are excluded from eligibility as UAI host nodes.  ncn-m001-pit# kubectl get no -l uas=False Example output:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.20.13 NOTE: Given the fact that labels are textual not boolean, it is a good idea to try various common spellings of false. The ones that will prevent UAIs from running are \u0026lsquo;False\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;FALSE\u0026rsquo;. Repeat the above with all three options to be sure.\nOf the non-master nodes, there is one node in this example that is configured to reject UAIs, ncn-w001. So, ncn-w002 and ncn-w003 are UAI host nodes.\nSpecify UAI Host Nodes UAI host nodes are determined by labeling the nodes to reject UAIs. For example:\nncn-m001-pit# kubectl label node ncn-w001 uas=False --overwrite Please note here that setting uas=True or any variant of that, while potentially useful for local book keeping purposes, does NOT transform the node into a UAS host node. With that setting the node will be a UAS node because the value of the uas flag is not in the list False, false or FALSE, but unless the node previously had one of the false values, it was a UAI node all along. Perhaps more to the point, removing the uas label from a node labeled uas=True does not take the node out of the list of UAI host nodes. The only way to make a non-master Kubernetes node not be a UAS host node is to explicitly set the label to False, false or FALSE.\nMaintain an HSM Group for UAI Host Nodes When it comes to customizing non-compute node (NCN) contents for UAIs, it is useful to have a Hardware State Manager (HSM) node group containing the NCNs that are UAI hosts nodes. The hpe-csm-scripts package provides a script called make_node_groups that is useful for this purpose. This script is normally installed as /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups. It can create and update node groups for management master nodes, storage nodes, management worker nodes, and UAI host nodes.\nThe following summarizes its use:\nncn-m001# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups --help Example output:\ngetopt: unrecognized option '--help' usage: make_node_groups [-m][-s][-u][w][-A][-R][-N] Where: -m - creates a node group for management master nodes -s - creates a node group for management storage nodes -u - creates a node group for UAI worker nodes -w - creates a node group for management worker nodes -A - creates all of the above node groups -N - executes a dry run, showing commands not running them -R - deletes existing node group(s) before creating them Here is an example of a dry-run that will create or update a node group for UAI host nodes:\nncn-m001# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups -N -R -u Example output:\n(dry run)cray hsm groups delete uai (dry run)cray hsm groups create --label uai (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s4b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s5b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s6b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s7b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s8b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s9b0n0 Notice that when run in dry-run (-N option) mode, the script only prints out the CLI commands it will execute without actually executing them. When run with the -R option, the script removes any existing node groups before recreating them, effectively updating the contents of the node group. The -u option tells the script to create or update only the node group for UAI host nodes. That node group is named uai in the HSM.\nSo, to create a new node group or replace an existing one, called uai, containing the list of UAI host nodes, use the following command:\n# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups -R -u Use Kubernetes Taints and Tolerations to Make NCNs Exclusive UAI Hosts If a site has the NCN resources to host UAIs exclusively on a set of NCNs without impacting the operation of the HPE Cray EX System Management Plane, it is recommended to isolate UAIs on NCNs that do not also host Management Plane services. This can be done using Kubernetes Taints and Tolerations. By default, UAIs tolerate running on nodes where the uai_only taint has been set, while management services beyond the minimal set required to make the node a functioning Kubernetes Worker node on HPE Cray EX do not tolerate that taint. By adding that taint to nodes in the Kubernetes cluster, sites can keep management services away from those nodes while allowing UAIs to run there. By further adding the uas=False label to all worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster where UAIs are not allowed, sites can ensure that UAIs only run on exclusive UAI hosts.\nFurther selection of UAI hosts can be achieved by any site by adding further taints to Kubernetes nodes, and configuring tolerations for those taints into specific UAI Classes.\nNext Topic: UAI macvlans Network Attachments\n"

UAS provides a a mechanism using Kubernetes labels to prevent UAIs from running on a specific worker nodes, but any Kubernetes node that is not labeled to prevent UAIs from running on it is considered eligible to host UAIs. The administrator of a given site may control the set of UAI host nodes by labeling Kubernetes worker nodes appropriately.\nCertain product installation procedures call for the installation of product components on the UAI Host Nodes so that UAIs can use those resources directly from the host node (as opposed to, for example, external shared storage). It is important to make sure that any such resources are maintained on the UAI host nodes. If a UAI is configured to use resources from the host node that cannot be found, then the UAI will fail to start, usually remaining in a Waiting state. This documentation contains procedures for diagnosing and fixing issues related to missing host node resources.\nNodes can also be \u0026ldquo;tainted\u0026rdquo; in Kubernetes to permit UAIs but not permit general HPE Cray EX System management plane services to run on those nodes.

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: List UAIs\nUAI Management UAS supports two manual methods and one automated method of UAI management:\n Direct administrative UAI management Legacy mode user driven UAI management UAI broker mode UAI management  Direct administrative UAI management is available mostly to allow administrators to set up Broker UAIs for the Broker Mode UAI Management and to control UAIs that are created under one of the other two methods. It is unlikely that a site will choose to create End-User UAIs this way, but it is possible to do. The administrative UAI management API provides an administrative way to list, create, examine and delete UAIs.\nThe legacy mode of UAI management gives users the authority to create, list and delete UAIs that belong to them. While this is a conceptually simple mode, it can lead to an unnecessary proliferation of UAIs belonging to a single user if the user is not careful to create UAIs only when needed. The legacy mode also cannot take advantage of the breadth of UAI classes to create more than one kind of UAI for different users' needs. In the legacy mode, UAIs can be created using a default UAI Class as a template and will always be created this way if a default UAI Class is configured, or, in the absence of a default UAI Class, using any of the registered UAI images and all of the volumes configured in the UAS. Use of a default UAI Class for legacy mode UAI creation is strongly advised.\nBroker UAIs mode creates / re-use UAIs on demand when a user logs into a Broker UAI using SSH. A site may run multiple Broker UAIs, each configured to create UAIs of a different UAI class and each running with its own externally visible IP address. By choosing the correct IP address and logging into the broker, a user ultimately arrives in an End-User UAI tailored for a given use case. Because the broker is responsible for managing the underlying End-User UAIs, users need not be given authority to create UAIs directly and, therefore, cannot cause a proliferation of unneeded UAIs. Because the Broker UAIs each run separately on different IP addresses with, potentially, different user authorizations configured, a site can control which users are given access to which classes of End-User UAIs.\nNext Topic: List UAIs\n"

Customization of the network attachments may be needed by some sites to, for example, increase the size of the reserved sub-net used for UAI macvlan attachments.\nCSI Localization Data The details of CSI localization are beyond the scope of this guide, but here are the important settings, and the values used in the following examples:\n The interface name on which the Kubernetes worker nodes reach their NMN subnet: bond0.nmn0 The network and CIDR configured on that interface: 10.252.0.0/17 The IP address of the gateway to other NMN subnets found on that network: 10.252.0.1 The subnets where compute nodes reside on this system:  10.92.100.0/24 10.106.0.0/17 10.104.0.0/17    Contents of customizations.yaml When CSI runs, it produces the following data structure in the spec section of customizations.yaml:\nspec: [...] wlm: [...] macvlansetup: nmn_subnet: 10.252.2.0/23 nmn_supernet: 10.252.0.0/17 nmn_supernet_gateway: 10.252.0.1 nmn_vlan: bond0.nmn0 # NOTE: the term DHCP here is misleading, this is merely # a range of reserved IP addresses for UAIs that should not # be handed out to others because the network # attachment will hand them out to UAIs. nmn_dhcp_start: 10.252.2.10 nmn_dhcp_end: 10.252.3.254 routes: - dst: 10.92.100.0/24 gw: 10.252.0.1 - dst: 10.106.0.0/17 gw: 10.252.0.1 - dst: 10.104.0.0/17 gw: 10.252.0.1 The nmn_subnet value shown here is not relevant for this section.\nThese values, in turn, feed into the following translation to UAS Helm chart settings:\n cray-uas-mgr: uasConfig: uai_macvlan_interface: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_vlan }}' uai_macvlan_network: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_supernet }}' uai_macvlan_range_start: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_dhcp_start }}' uai_macvlan_range_end: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_dhcp_end }}' uai_macvlan_routes: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.routes }}' UAS Helm Chart The inputs in the previous section tell the UAS Helm chart how to install the network attachment for UAIs. While the actual template used for this is more complex, the following is a simplified view of the template used to generate the network attachment.\napiVersion: \u0026quot;k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1\u0026quot; kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition [...] spec: config: '{ \u0026quot;cniVersion\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.3.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;macvlan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;master\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_interface }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bridge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ipam\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;host-local\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subnet\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_network }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeStart\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_range_start }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeEnd\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_range_end }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;routes\u0026quot;: [ {{- range $index, $route := .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_routes }} {{- range $key, $value := $route }} { \u0026quot;{{ $key }}\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ $value }}\u0026quot;, }, {{- end }} {{- end }} ] } }' The range templating in the routes section expands the routes from customizations.yaml into the network attachment routes.\nUAI Network Attachment in Kubernetes All of this produces a network attachment definition in Kubernetes called macvlan-uas-nmn-conf which is used by UAS.\nThe following contents would result from the above data:\napiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1 kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition ... spec: config: '{ \u0026quot;cniVersion\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.3.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;macvlan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;master\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bond0.nmn0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bridge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ipam\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;host-local\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subnet\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeStart\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.124.10\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeEnd\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.125.244\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;routes\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.92.100.0/24\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.106.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.104.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; } ] } }' ... In this example, Kubernetes will assign UAI IP addresses in the range 10.252.2.10 through 10.252.3.244 on the network attachment, and will permit those UAIs to reach compute nodes on any of four possible NMN subnets:\n Directly through the NMN subnet hosting the UAI host node itself (10.252.0.0/17 here) Through the gateway in the local NMN subnet (10.252.0.1 here) to  10.92.100.0/24 10.106.0.0/17 10.104.0.0/17    Next Topic: Configure UAIs in UAS\n"

The symptom of this is that a user logging into a Broker UAI will receive a password prompt from the End-User UAI and be unable to log in even if providing the correct password. To fix this, remove the stale End-User UAIs and allow the Broker UAI to recreate them.

A good place to start is in the Events section at the bottom. Notice the warnings here about volumes whose secrets and configmaps are not found. In this case, that means the UAI cannot start because it was started in legacy mode without a default UAI class, and some of the volumes configured in the UAS are in the uas namespace to support localization of Broker UAIs and cannot be found in the user namespace. To solve this particular problem, the best move would be to configure a default UAI class with the correct volume list in it, delete the UAI, and allow the user to try creating it again using the default class.\nOther problems can usually be quickly identified using this and other information found in the output from the kubectl describe pod command.\n  Next Topic: Troubleshoot Duplicate Mount Paths in a UAI\n"

To do this, either set the KUBECONFIG environment variable or set the --kubeconfig flag .\nTroubleshoot X11 Issues The system may return the following error if the user attempts to use an application that requires an X window (such as xeyes):\n$ ssh user@203.0.113.0 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa Example output:\n ______ ____ ___ __ __ __ __ ___ ____ / ____// __ \\ / |\\ \\/ / / / / // | / _/ / / / /_/ // /| | \\ / / / / // /| | / / / /___ / _, _// ___ | / / / /_/ // ___ | _/ / \\____//_/ |_|/_/ |_|/_/ \\____//_/ |_|/___/ [user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]$ xeyes Error: Can't open display: To resolve this issue, pass the -X option with the ssh command as show below:\n$ ssh UAI_USERNAME@UAI_IP_ADDRESS -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -X Example output:\n ______ ____ ___ __ __ __ __ ___ ____ / ____// __ \\ / |\\ \\/ / / / / // | / _/ / / / /_/ // /| | \\ / / / / // /| | / / / /___ / _, _// ___ | / / / /_/ // ___ | _/ / \\____//_/ |_|/_/ |_|/_/ \\____//_/ |_|/___/ /usr/bin/xauth: file /home/users/user/.Xauthority does not exist [user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]$ echo $DISPLAY 203.0.113.0 The warning stating \u0026ldquo;Xauthority does not exist\u0026rdquo; will disappear with subsequent logins.\nTroubleshoot SSH Host Key Issues If strict host key checking enabled is enabled on the user\u0026rsquo;s client, the below error may appear when connecting to a UAI over ssh.\nWARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED This can occur in a few circumstances, but is most likely to occur after the UAI container is restarted. If this occurs, remove the offending ssh hostkey from the local known_hosts file and try to connect again. The error message from ssh will contain the correct path to the known_hosts file and the line number of the problematic key.\nDelete UAS Objects with kubectl If Kubernetes resources used to create a UAI are not cleaned up during the normal deletion process, resources can be deleted with the following commands.\nDelete anything created by the User Access Service (uas-mgr):\nWARNING: This command will delete all UAS resources for the entire system, it is not for targeted cleanup of a single UAI.\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l uas=managed Delete all objects associated with a particular UAI:\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l app=UAI-NAME Delete all objects for a single user:\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l user=USERNAME Hard limits on UAI Creation Each Kubernetes worker node has limits on how many pods it can run. Nodes are installed by default with a hard limit of 110 pods per node, but the number of pods may be further limited by memory and CPU utilization constraints. For a standard node the maximum number of UAIs per node is 110; if other pods are co-scheduled on the node, the number will be reduced.\nDetermine the hard limit on Kubernetes pods with kubectl describe node and look for the Capacity section.\n# kubectl describe node NODE_NAME -o yaml Example output:\n[...] capacity: cpu: \u0026quot;16\u0026quot; ephemeral-storage: 1921298528Ki hugepages-1Gi: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; hugepages-2Mi: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; memory: 181009640Ki pods: \u0026quot;110\u0026quot; [...] When UAIs are created, some UAIs might left in the \u0026ldquo;Pending\u0026rdquo; state. The Kubernetes scheduler is unable to schedule them to a node, because of CPU, memory, or pod limit constraints. Use kubectl describe pod to check why the pod is pending. For example, this pod is \u0026ldquo;Pending\u0026rdquo; because the node has reached the hard limit of 110 pods.\n# kubectl describe pod UAI-POD Example output:\nWarning Failed Scheduling 21s (x20 over 4m31s) default-scheduler 0/4 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient pods, 3 node(s) didn't match node selector.

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Broker Mode UAI Management\nBroker UAI Resiliency and Load Balancing Broker UAI resiliency and load balancing is achieved through the use of Multi-Replica Broker UAIs. The procedures and data involved in configuring a UAI Class to create Multi-Replica Broker UAIs can be found in UAI Classes. This page describes some of the reasons to use Multi-Replica Broker UAIs and some of the implications of doing so.\nWhen a Broker UAI runs with multiple replicas, access to the broker remains channeled through a single external IP address, but the connections are load balanced and dispatched to multiple Kubernetes pods where the Broker UAI functionality is running. This has two beneficial effects:\n SSH Connections to Broker UAIs are load balanced so that no single broker carries all of the weight of users logged into or copying data to UAIs of a given class Individual Broker UAI pods can be evicted or restarted by Kubernetes without interrupting access to End-User UAIs  NOTE: When a Broker UAI pod terminates for any reason, all SSH sessions going through that pod are dropped. This is because the Broker UAI pods forward SSH sessions to the End-User UAIs, so they are always an active part of the connection.\nThe number of replicas a Multi-Replica UAI Broker should have is dictated primarily by the number of host nodes on which Broker UAIs can be deployed. From a load-balancing perspective, it makes sense to make the number of replicas equal to the number of available host nodes. From a resiliency perspective, that number could be considerably smaller (3 for example) on the assumption that multi-node failures or evictions are unlikely, and brokers that are evicted or restarted will start up relatively quickly elsewhere. It does not make sense from either perspective, however, to over-subscribe the available number of host nodes (except, perhaps during a temporary outage) since that will result in no additional resiliency and the potential for network traffic and resource consumption hot spots.\nNext Topic: Broker Mode UAI Management\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Log in to a Broker UAI\nStart a Broker UAI Create a Broker UAI after a Broker UAI class has been created.\nPrerequisites  The administrator must be logged into an NCN or a host that has administrative access to the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must have the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray command) installed on the above host The HPE Cray EX System CLI must be configured (initialized - cray init command) to reach the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must be logged in as an administrator to the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray auth login command) There must be an appropriate Broker UAI Class defined: Configure a Broker UAI Class. The administrator must know the Class ID of the desired Broker UAI Class: List UAI Classes  Optional: the administrator may choose a site defined name for the Broker UAI to be used in conjunction with the HPE Cray EX System External DNS mechanism.\nProcedure Use the following command to create a Broker UAI:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais create --class-id \u0026lt;class-id\u0026gt; [--owner \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;] To make the broker obvious in the list of UAIs, giving it an owner name of broker is handy. The owner name on a broker is used for naming and filtering (for listing or deleting), but nothing else, so this is a convenient convention. Alternatively, giving it a descriptive owner to make it easy to tell the differences between brokers of different kinds can be useful. Keep in mind that the owner here can only be lower-case alphanumeric or - (dash) characters.\nThe following is an example using the class created above:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais create --class-id d764c880-41b8-41e8-bacc-f94f7c5b053d --owner broker Example output:\nuai_age = \u0026quot;0m\u0026quot; uai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh broker@35.226.246.154\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w003\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:1.2.4\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;35.226.246.154\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;uai-broker-70512bbb\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Running: Ready\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;broker\u0026quot; [uai_portmap] When a UAI is created on an external IP address (as is always the case with Broker UAIs) the UAI name (uai_name field above) is given to the HPE Cray EX System External DNS mechanism to be advertised to the site DNS. Unless a site defined name is used, a unique name like the one shown above is calculated and used. If a site defined DNS name for the Broker UAI is desired, the UAI name may be added to the command that creates the Broker UAI as follows:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais create --class-id d764c880-41b8-41e8-bacc-f94f7c5b053d --owner broker --uai-name my-broker-uai Example output:\nuai_age = \u0026quot;0m\u0026quot; uai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh broker@35.226.246.154\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w003\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:1.2.4\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;35.226.246.154\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;my-broker-uai\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Running: Ready\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;broker\u0026quot; [uai_portmap] If a UAI name is specified for creation that matches that of an already created UAI, no new UAI will be created, but the creation operation will appear to succeed and will return the status of the already existing UAI.\nNext Topic: Log in to a Broker UAI\n"

Please check that the file is accessible only by the owner and owned by root.root.   Problem Explanation In the current release of UAS, the default Service Account on the uas namespace in Kubernetes is bound to a Cluster Role that uses a Pod Security Policy that defines a specific fsGroup range and a MustRunAs rule instead of simply using the RunAsAny rule. Because of the way Kubernetes handles volumes, when a volume containing a Secret or a ConfigMap is mounted on a Kubernetes pod with an fsGroup rule that is not RunAsAny in the Pod Security Policy, the requested mode of the volume is adjusted to something Kubernetes deems more appropriate. In this case, the requested mode (decimal 384 or octal 600) becomes octal 640 instead in the mounted volume. Unfortunately, SSSD requires that this mode be octal 600 or it will refuse to use the configuration file.\nWorkaround While this problem will be resolved in an upcoming release of UAS, if this behavior occurs, it is necessary to create a new Pod Security Policy and a Cluster Role using that Pod Security Policy, then change the existing Cluster Role Binding to bind the new Cluster Role instead of the one it currently uses. The following procedure does that.\n  Verify that the system is set up the same way as the system on which this workaround was prepared. To do that, list the Cluster Role Binding named uas-default-psp and determine what Cluster Role it is bound to:\nncn-m001# kubectl get clusterrolebindings uas-default-psp -o yaml Example output:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: ... roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: restricted-transition-net-raw-psp subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default namespace: uas Notice the roleRef setting binds the restricted-transition-net-raw-psp Cluster Role. That Cluster Role uses the restricted-transition-net-raw-psp Pod Security Policy, which is used by several CSM services, but does not work for Broker UAIs.\nAssuming the system is configured as shown above, the following steps will\n Remove the existing incorrect ClusterRoleBinding so that it can be replaced later. Create a new Pod Security Policy called uas-default-psp. Create a Cluster Role called uas-default-psp that uses the new Pod Security Policy Replace the Cluster Role Binding called uas-default-psp with a new one that binds the new Cluster Role to the default Service Account in the uas namespace.  If the system is configured differently, it may be necessary to investigate further, which is largely beyond the scope of this section. The important thing here is that the default Service Account in the uas namespace must not be bound to a Pod Security Policy with an fsGroup or supplementalGroups configured with anything but the RunAsAny rule.\n  Remove the existing Cluster Role Binding:\nncn-m001# kubectl delete clusterrolebindings uas-default-psp   Prepare a YAML file containing the new Kubernetes objects:\nncn-m001# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; /tmp/uas-default-psp.yaml apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: uas-default-psp spec: allowPrivilegeEscalation: true allowedCapabilities: - NET_ADMIN - NET_RAW allowedHostPaths: - pathPrefix: /lustre - pathPrefix: /root/registry - pathPrefix: /lib/modules - pathPrefix: / - pathPrefix: /var/lib/nfsroot/nmd - pathPrefix: /lus - pathPrefix: /var/tmp/cps-local fsGroup: rule: RunAsAny hostNetwork: true privileged: true runAsUser: rule: RunAsAny seLinux: rule: RunAsAny supplementalGroups: rule: RunAsAny volumes: - configMap - emptyDir - projected - secret - downwardAPI - persistentVolumeClaim - hostPath - flexVolume --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: uas-default-psp rules: - apiGroups: - policy resourceNames: - uas-default-psp resources: - podsecuritypolicies verbs: - use --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: uas-default-psp roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: uas-default-psp subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default namespace: uas EOF   Apply this new configuration to Kubernetes:\nncn-m001# kubectl apply -f /tmp/uas-default-psp.yaml   Delete and re-create the offending Broker UAI(s) and they should come up and SSSD should run properly.\nncn-m001# cray uas admin uais delete OPTIONS ncn-m001# cray uas admin uais create OPTIONS   Next Topic: Clear UAS Configuration\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Broker UAI Resiliency and Load Balancing\nSetting UAI Timeouts The procedures and specific values used for setting UAI timeouts are explained in the UAI Classes section. Please refer to that section.\nOn systems where UAIs are used as part of normal user activities, the number of UAIs can grow large. Stale UAIs (i.e. UAIs that sit idle for long periods of time) can prevent creation of fresh UAIs for users who are actually active on the system. To address this without constant administrative monitoring, UAS permits the administrator to place both hard and soft timeouts on UAI Classes, which then constrain the amount of time a UAI can exist before it will terminate and need to be recreated. UAI timeouts are particularly useful in the Brokered UAI Management mode because automatic creation of UAIs makes the coming and going of UAIs seamless, and also tends to cause the creation of many UAIs. UAI timeouts are also useful in the Legacy UAI Management mode, however, since, in that mode, it is common for users to create a UAI for a task and forget to remove it when the task is done. This can be compounded by the user forgetting that a UAI already exists and making another.\nThe choice of what kind of timeouts and the duration of the timeouts is likely to be very site specific, however some general guidelines apply, especially when it comes to choosing what kinds of timeouts to use.\nIf a Class of UAI has users who tend to remain logged in and actively using their UAIs for long periods of time, it can make sense to set a soft timeout without setting a hard timeout on that UAI Class. In this case, a reasonably aggressive (30 minutes, for example) soft timeout can keep idle UAIs to a minimum while not impeding users who need to remain logged into their UAIs for days or weeks.\nNOTE: consider moving users with workflows like the above onto UANs instead of UAIs if the site provides UANs due to the inherent impermanence of End-User UAIs.\nIf a UAI Class is intended to provide UAIs for occasional launching or checking the status of workload management jobs and not for extended login sessions, it may make sense to set a fairly aggressive hard timeout (10 minutes, for example) and a very aggressive (30 seconds, for example) soft timeout. This will make sure that users do not overstay their welcome in this class of UAI, and will generally cause the UAI to terminate as soon as the user logs out.\nIf a UAI Class creates more general purpose UAIs that are neither especially disruptive when they time out nor intended for especially short term work, a somewhat generous (24 hours, for example) hard timeout combined with a fairly aggressive (30 minutes, for example) soft timeout will keep idle UAIs of that class under control while permitting longer term users to stay logged in without giving them unlimited login durations.\nIf hard timeouts are used, a warning should usually be added to the timeout specification in the UAI Class. This will give users a chance to finish up any in-progress work and log out prior to termination of the UAI as a result of the hard timeout.\nNext Topic: Broker UAI Resiliency and Load Balancing\n"

JSON is the required input format for volume descriptions in UAS.\nLooking at the above output, each volume has a mount_path, volume_description, volume_name and volume_id entry.\nThe mount_path specifies where in the UAI the volume will be mounted.\nNOTE: While it is acceptable to have multiple volumes configured in UAS with the same mount_path, any given UAI will fail creation if it has more than one volume specified for a given mount path. If multiple volumes with the same mount path exist in the UAS configuration, all UAIs must be created using UAI classes that specify a workable subset of volumes. A UAI created without a UAI Class under such a UAS configuration will try to use all configured volumes and creation will fail.\nThe volume_description is the JSON description of the volume, specified as a dictionary with one entry, whose key identifies the kind of Kubernetes volume is described (i.e. host_path, configmap, secret, etc.) whose value is another dictionary containing the Kubernetes volume description itself. See Kubernetes documentation for details on what goes in various kinds of volume descriptions.\nThe volumename is a string the creator of the volume may chose to describe or name the volume. It must be comprised of only lower case alphanumeric characters and dashes ('-') and must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. It is used inside the UAI pod specification to identify the volume that is mounted in a given location in a container. The name is required and administrators are free to use any name that meets the above requirements. Volume names do need to be unique within any given UAI and are far more useful when searching for a volume if they are unique across the entire UAS configuration.\nThe volume_id is a unique identifier used to identify the UAS volume when examining, updating or deleting a volume and when linking a volume to a UAI class. It is assigned automatically by UAS.\nNext Topic: Add a Volume to UAS\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Special Purpose UAIs\nEnd-User UAIs UAIs used for interactive logins are called End-User UAIs. End-User UAIs can be seen as lightweight User Access Nodes (UANs), but there are important differences between UAIs and UANs.\nEnd-User UAIs are not dedicated hardware like UANs. They are implemented as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, which makes them subject to Kubernetes scheduling and resource management rules. One key element of Kubernetes orchestration is impermanence. While End-User UAIs are often long running, Kubernetes can reschedule or recreate them as needed to meet resource and node availability constraints. UAIs can also be removed administratively.\nEnd-User UAIs can also be configured with soft and hard timeout values. Reaching a soft timeout causes the UAI to be removed automatically when it is or becomes idle \u0026ndash; defined as having no logged in user sessions. Reaching a hard timeout causes the UAI to be removed immediately regardless of logged in user sessions.\nWhen any of these things cause a UAI to terminate, a new UAI may be created, but that new UAI reverts to its initial state, discarding any internal changes that might have been made in its previous incarnation. State residing on external storage is, of course, preserved and available in the new End-User UAI.\nAn administratively removed End-User UAI or an End-User UAI terminated by a timeout may or may not ever be re-created. An End-User UAI that is preempted because of resource pressure or other Kubernetes scheduling reasons may become unavailable for an extended time until the pressure is relieved, but will usually return to service once the underlying issue is resolved.\nThe impermanence of End-User UAIs makes them suitable for tasks that are immediate and interactive over relatively short time frames, such as building and testing software or launching workloads. This impermanence makes them unsuitable for unattended activities like executing cron jobs or continuous monitoring of workload progress from a logged-in shell. These kinds of activities are more suited to UANs, which are more permanent and, unless they are re-installed, retain modified state through reboots and other interruptions.\nAnother way End-User UAIs differ from UANs is that any given End-User UAI is restricted to serving a single user. This protects users from interfering with each other within UAIs and means that any user who wants to use a UAI has to arrange for the UAI to be created and assigned. The Brokered UAI Management mode simplifies this process by providing automatic creation of and connection to UAIs using SSH logins. Once a user has an End-User UAI assigned, the user may initiate any number of SSH sessions to that UAI (or, in the case of Broker UAIs the broker serving that UAI), but no other user will be recognized by the UAI when attempting to connect. In case of Broker UAIs each unique user will be assigned a unique End-User UAI upon successful login. Multiple sessions of the same user will be will be forwarded by the Broker UAI to the same End-User UAI.\nNext Topic: Special Purpose UAIs\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Configure A Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode\nLegacy Mode User-Driven UAI Management In the legacy mode, users create and manage their own UAIs through the Cray CLI. A user may create, list and delete only UAIs owned by the user. The user may not create a UAI for another user, nor may the user see or delete UAIs owned by another user. Once created, the information describing the UAI gives the user the information needed to reach the UAI using SSH and log into it.\nThe following diagram illustrates a system running with UAIs created in the legacy mode by four users, each of whom has created at least one End-User UAI. Notice that the example user Pat has created two End-User UAIs:\nIn the simplest UAS configuration, there is some number of UAI images available for use in legacy mode and there is a set of volumes defined. In this configuration, when a UAI is created, the user may specify the UAI image to use as an option when creating the UAI, or may allow a default UAI image, if one is assigned, to be used. Every volume defined at the time the UAI is created will be mounted unconditionally in every newly created UAI if this approach is used. This can lead to problems with conflicting volume mount points (see Troubleshoot Duplicate Mount Paths in a UAI) and unresolvable volumes (see Troubleshoot UAI Stuck in \u0026ldquo;ContainerCreating\u0026rdquo;) in some configurations of UAS. Unless UAI classes are used to make UAIs, care must be taken to ensure all volumes have unique mount-path settings and are accessible in the user Kubernetes namespace.\nThe Benefits of Using UAI Classes with Legacy Mode A slightly more sophisticated configuration approach defines a default UAI Class that is always used by legacy mode UAI creation. When this approach is taken, the user can no longer specify the image to use, as it will be supplied by the UAI class, and the volumes mounted in any UAI created in legacy mode will be based on the specified UAI class. As long as volumes do not conflict within the list of volumes in a given UAI class, there is no need to avoid duplicate mount-path settings in the global list of volumes when this approach is used. All other configuration in the default UAI Class will also be applied to all new legacy mode UAIs, so, for example, a site can place timeouts or resource specifications on UAIs by defining them in the default UAI Class.\nThe UAI Classes section provides information on what might go in an End-User UAI Class and what should specifically go in the Non-Brokered UAI Class used in legacy mode.\nNext Topic: Configure A Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode\n"

Custom images are created, installed and registered as part of the Customize End-User UAI Images procedure.\nThis procedure describes how to list the currently registered UAI images.\nPrerequisites  The administrator must be logged into an NCN or a host that has administrative access to the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must have the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray command) installed on the above host The HPE Cray EX System CLI must be configured (initialized - cray init command) to reach the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must be logged in as an administrator to the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray auth login command)  Procedure Obtain the list of UAI images that are currently registered with UAS.\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config images list Example output:\n[[results]] default = true image_id = \u0026quot;08a04462-195a-4e66-aa31-08076072c9b3\u0026quot; imagename = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uas-sles15:latest\u0026quot; [[results]] default = false image_id = \u0026quot;f8d5f4da-c910-421c-92b6-794ab8cc7e70\u0026quot; imagename = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:latest\u0026quot; [[results]] default = false image_id = \u0026quot;8fdf5d4a-c190-24c1-2b96-74ab98c7ec07\u0026quot; imagename = \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/custom-end-user-uai:latest\u0026quot; The output shown above shows three image registrations.

The image must also be created and stored in the container registry. See Customize End-User UAI Images.\nThere is also a default flag. If this flag is true, the image will be used, in the absence of a default UAI Class, whenever a UAI is created without specifying an image or UAI Class as part of the creation. Finally, there is an image_id, which identifies this image registration for later inspection, update, or deletion and for linking the image to a UAI Class.\nNext Topic: Register a UAI Image\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Customize End-User UAI Images\nCustomize the Broker UAI Image The Broker UAI image that comes with UAS is the image used to construct Broker UAIs.\nThe key pieces of the Broker UAI image are:\n An entrypoint shell script that initializes the container and starts the SSH daemon running. An SSH configuration that forces logged in users into the switchboard command which creates / selects End-User UAIs and redirects connections.  The primary way to customize the Broker UAI image is by defining volumes and connecting them to the Broker UAI class for a given broker. Some customizations may require action that cannot be covered simply by using volumes to override configuration. Those cases generally require changing the Broker UAI behavior in some way. Those cases can be covered either by volume mounting a customized entrypoint script, or volume mounting a customized SSH configuration. Both of these cases are shown in the following examples.\nCustomize the Broker UAI Entrypoint Script The Broker UAI entrypoint script runs once every time the Broker UAI starts. It resides at /app/broker/entrypoint.sh in the Broker UAI image. The entrypoint script is the only file in that directory, so it can be overridden by creating a Kubernetes ConfigMap in the uas namespace containing the modified script and creating a volume using that ConfigMap with a mount point of /app/broker. There is critical content in the entrypoint script that should not be modified.\nThe following shows the contents of an unmodified script:\n#!/bin/bash # MIT License # # (C) Copyright [2020] Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP # # Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a # copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026quot;Software\u0026quot;), # to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation # the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, # and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the # Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: # # The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included # in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. # # THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR # IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The configuration here assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server for authentication and that, if a home directory is not present for a user at login, one should be made on the broker. The ssh-keygen... part is needed to set up the SSH host key for the broker and should be left alone. The UAI_CREATION_CLASS code should be left alone, as it sets up information used by switchboard to create End-User UAIs. The /usr/sbin/sshd... part starts the SSH server on the broker and should be left alone. Configuration of SSH is covered in the next section and is done by replacing /etc/switchboard/sshd_config not by modifying this line. The sssd part assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server, it can be changed as needed. The sleep infinity prevents the script from exiting which keeps the Broker UAI running. It should not be removed or altered.  As long as the basic flow and contents described here are honored, other changes to this script should work without compromising the Broker UAI\u0026rsquo;s function.\nThe following is an example of replacing the entrypoint script with a new entrypoint script that changes the SSSD invocation to explicitly specify the sssd.conf file path (the standard path is used here, but a different path might make customizing SSSD for a given site simpler under some set of circumstances):\n  Create a new entrypoint script.\nNOTE: A special \u0026ldquo;here document\u0026rdquo; form is used to prevent variable substitution in the file.\nncn-m001-pit# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;EOF\u0026quot; \u0026gt; entrypoint.sh #!/bin/bash # MIT License # # (C) Copyright [2020] Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP # # Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a # copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026quot;Software\u0026quot;), # to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation # the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, # and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the # Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: # # The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included # in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. # # THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR # IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The UseDNS no avoids any DNS issues resulting from the Broker UAI running in the Kubernetes network space. The permitTTY yes setting permits interactive UAI logins. The ForceCommand ... statement ensures that users are always sent on to End-User UAIs or drop out of the Broker UAI on failure, preventing users from directly accessing the Broker UAI. The AcceptEnv UAI_ONE_SHOT setting is not required, but it allows a user to set the UAI_ONE_SHOT variable which instructs the broker to delete any created End-User UAI after the user logs out.  These should be left unchanged.

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: UAI Host Nodes\nElements of a UAI All UAIs can have the following attributes associated with them:\n A required container image An optional set of volumes An optional resource specification An optional collection of other configuration items  This topic explains each of these attributes.\nUAI container image The container image for a UAI (UAI image) defines and provides the basic environment available to the user. This environment includes, among other things:\n The operating system (including version) Preinstalled packages  A site can customize UAI images and add those images to UAS, allowing them to be used for UAI creation. Any number of UAI images can be configured in UAS, though only one will be used by any given UAI.\nUAS provides two UAI images by default. These images enable HPE Cray EX administrators to set up UAIs and run many common tasks. The first image is a standard End-User UAI image that has the software necessary to support a basic Linux login experience. This is primarily intended to give administrators a way to get started with UAIs and experiment with their configuration. The second image is a Broker UAI image. Broker UAIs present a single SSH endpoint that every user of a given class of UAIs logs into. The Broker UAI then locates or creates a suitable End-User UAI and redirects the SSH session to that End-User UAI.\nUAI Volumes The volumes defined for a UAI provide external access to data provided by the host node. Anything that can be defined as a volume in a Kubernetes pod specification can be configured in UAS as a volume and used within a UAI. Examples include:\n Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets External file systems used for persistent storage or external data access Host node files and directories  When UAIs are created they mount a list of volumes inside their containers to give them access to various data provided either by Kubernetes resources or through Kubernetes by the host node where the UAI runs. Which volumes are in that list depends on how the UAI is created:\n UAIs created without using a UAI class mount all volumes configured in UAS. UAIs created using a UAI Class mount only the volumes listed in the UAI Class and configured in UAS.  The following are some example use cases for UAI volumes:\n Connecting UAIs to configuration files like /etc/localtime maintained by the host node. Connect End-User UAIs to Slurm or PBS Professional Workload Manager configuration shared through Kubernetes. Connecting End-User UAIs to Programming Environment libraries and tools hosted on the UAI host nodes. Connecting End-User UAIs to Lustre or other external storage for user data. Connecting Broker UAIs to a directory service or SSH configuration to authenticate and redirect user sessions.  Every UAS volume includes the following values in its registration information:\n mount_path: Specifies where in the UAI the volume will be mounted. volume_description: A dictionary with one entry, whose key identifies the kind of Kubernetes volume is described (for example, host_path, configmap, secret). The value associated with that key is another dictionary containing the Kubernetes volume description itself. volumename: A required string chosen by the creator of the volume. This may describe or name the volume. It is used inside the UAI pod specification to identify the volume that is mounted in a given location in a container. A volumename is unique within any given UAI, but not necessarily within UAS. These are useful when searching for a volume if they are unique across the UAS configuration. volume_id: Used to identify the UAS volume when examining, updating, or deleting a volume and when linking a volume to a UAI class. The volume_id is generated by and unique within UAS.  Refer to Kubernetes Documentation describing Volumes for more information about Kubernetes volumes.\nResource Specifications A resource request tells Kubernetes the minimum amount of a given host node resource to give to each UAI. A resource limit sets the maximum amount of a given host node resource that Kubernetes can give to any UAI. Kubernetes uses resource limits and requests to manage the system resources available to pods. Because UAIs run as pods under Kubernetes, UAS takes advantage of Kubernetes to manage the system resources available to UAIs. In UAS, resource specifications contain that configuration. A UAI that is assigned a resource specification will use the resource requests and limits found there instead of the default resource limits or requests on the Kubernetes namespace containing the UAI. This way, resource specifications can be used to fine-tune resources assigned to UAIs of different classes.\nUAI resource specifications have three configurable parameters:\n A set of limits which is a JSON string describing Kubernetes resource limits. A set of requests which is a JSON string describing Kubernetes resource requests. An optional comment which is a free-form string containing any information an administrator might find useful about the resource specification.  Resource specifications also contain a resource-id that is used for examining, updating, or deleting the resource specification as well as linking the resource specification into a UAI class. Resource-ids are generated by UAS and unique to each resource specification.\nResource specifications configured in UAS contain resource requests, limits, or both, that can be associated with a UAI. Any resource request or limit that can be set up on a Kubernetes pod can be set up as a resource specification under UAS.\nOther Configuration Items There are also smaller configuration items that control things such as:\n Whether the UAI can talk to compute nodes over the high-speed network (needed for workload management). Whether the UAI presents a public facing or private facing IP address for SSH. Kubernetes scheduling priority. Timeout values for limiting the lifespan of active or idle UAIs  These items are configured in UAI Classes so only UAIs created from UAI Classes can have these settings.\nUAI Configuration and UAI Classes All of the above described UAI configuration and more can be encapsulated into a UAI Class, which can then be used to create UAIs with greater precision and efficiency. UAI Classes are especially important when using Broker UAIs because Broker UAIs use a UAI Creation Class configured into the Broker UAI\u0026rsquo;s class to determine what kind of End-User UAI to create when a user logs into the Broker.\nNext Topic: UAI Host Nodes\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Legacy Mode User-Driven UAI Management\nCustomize End-User UAI Images The provided End-User UAI image is a basic UAI image that includes an up-to-date version of the SLES Linux Distribution. It provides an entrypoint to using UAIs and an easy way for administrators to experiment with UAS configurations. To support building software to be run in compute nodes, or other HPC and Analytics workflows, it is necessary to create a custom End-User UAI image and use that.\nA custom End-User UAI image can be any container image set up with the End-User UAI entrypoint script. Experimentation with the wide range of possible UAI images is beyond the scope of this document, but the example given here should offer a starting point for that kind of experimentation.\nThe example provided here covers the most common use-case, which is building a UAI image from the squashfs image used on compute nodes on the host system to support application development, workload management and analytics workflows. Some of the steps are specific to that activity, others would be common to or similar to steps needed to create special purpose UAIs.\nPrerequisites  The administrator must be logged into an NCN or a host that has administrative access to the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must have the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray command) installed on the above host The HPE Cray EX System CLI must be configured (initialized - cray init command) to reach the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway The administrator must be logged in as an administrator to the HPE Cray EX System CLI (cray auth login command)  NOTE: this procedure cannot be run from a PIT node or an external host, it must be run from a Kubernetes Worker or Master node.\nProcedure   Choose a name for the custom image\nThis example names the custom End-User UAI image called registry.local/cray/cray-uai-compute:latest, and places that name in an environment variable for convenience. Alter the name as appropriate for the image to be created:\nncn-w001# UAI_IMAGE_NAME=registry.local/cray/cray-uai-compute:latest   Query BOS for a sessiontemplate ID.\nIdentify the Sessiontemplate name to use.

Refer to the \u0026ldquo;Boot COS\u0026rdquo; procedure in the COS product stream documentation. Near the end of that procedure, the step to create a BOS session to boot the compute nodes should contain the name.\nncn-w001# SESSION_NAME=wlm-sessiontemplate-0.1.0   Download a compute node SquashFS.\nUse the Sessiontemplate name to download a compute node squashfs from a BOS sessiontemplate name:\nncn-w001# SESSION_ID=$(cray bos sessiontemplate describe $SESSION_NAME --format json | jq -r '.boot_sets.compute.path' | awk -F/ '{print $4}') ncn-w001# cray artifacts get boot-images $SESSION_ID/rootfs rootfs.squashfs   Mount the SquashFS and create a tarball.\n  Create a directory and mount the SquashFS on the directory:\nncn-w001# mkdir -v mount ncn-w001# mount -v -o loop,ro rootfs.squashfs `pwd`/mount   Create the tarball.\nIMPORTANT: 99-slingshot-network.conf is omitted from the tarball as that prevents the UAI from running sshd as the UAI user with the su command:\nncn-w001# (cd `pwd`/mount; tar --xattrs --xattrs-include='*' --exclude=\u0026quot;99-slingshot-network.conf\u0026quot; -cf \u0026quot;../$SESSION_ID.tar\u0026quot; .) \u0026gt; /dev/null This may take several minutes. Notice that this does not create a compressed tarball. Using an uncompressed format makes it possible to add files if needed once the tarball is made. It also makes the procedure run just a bit more quickly. If warnings related to xattr are displayed, continue with the procedure as the resulting tarball should still result in a functioning UAI container image.\n  Check that the tarball contains \u0026lsquo;./usr/bin/uai-ssh.sh\u0026rsquo;.\nncn-w001# tar tf $SESSION_ID.tar | grep '[.]/usr/bin/uai-ssh[.]sh' ./usr/bin/uai-ssh.sh If this script is not present, the easiest place to get a copy of the script is from a UAI built from the End-User UAI image provided with UAS, and it can be appended to the tarball:\nncn-w001# mkdir -pv ./usr/bin ncn-w001# cray uas create --publickey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub uai_connect_string = \u0026quot;ssh vers@10.26.23.123\u0026quot; uai_host = \u0026quot;ncn-w001\u0026quot; uai_img = \u0026quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot; uai_ip = \u0026quot;10.26.23.123\u0026quot; uai_msg = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; uai_name = \u0026quot;uai-vers-32079250\u0026quot; uai_status = \u0026quot;Pending\u0026quot; username = \u0026quot;vers\u0026quot; [uai_portmap] ncn-w001# scp vers@10.26.23.123:/usr/bin/uai-ssh.sh ./usr/bin/uai-ssh.sh The authenticity of host '10.26.23.123 (10.26.23.123)' can't be established.

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Start a Broker UAI\nConfigure a Broker UAI Class Configuring a Broker UAI class consists of the following actions:\n Create volumes to hold any site-specific authentication, SSH, or other configuration required Choose the End-User UAI class for which the Broker UAI will serve instances Create a UAI Class with (at a minimum):  namespace set to uas default set to false volume_mounts set to the list of customization volume-ids created above public_ip set to true uai_compute_network set to false uai_creation_class set to the class-id of the End-User UAI class    The basic contents of a Broker UAI Class is discussed in UAI Classes. Familiarity with that information is assumed in the example below.\nExample of Volumes to Connect Broker UAIs to LDAP Broker UAIs authenticate each user using SSH, and pass the SSH connection on to the selected or created End-User UAI for that user. An authentication source is required to authenticate users. For sites that use LDAP as a directory server for authentication, connecting Broker UAIs to LDAP is simply a matter of replicating the LDAP configuration used by other nodes or systems at the site (UANs can be a good source of this configuration) inside the Broker UAI. This section shows how to do that using volumes, which permits the standard Broker UAI image to be used out of the box and reconfigured at the site without direct modification.\nWhile it would be possible to make the configuration available as files volume mounted from the host node of the Broker UAI, this is difficult to set up and maintain because it means that the configuration files must be present and synchronized across all UAI host nodes. A more practical approach to this is to install the configuration files in Kubernetes as secrets, and then mount them from Kubernetes directly. This ensures that no matter where a Broker UAI runs, it has access to the configuration.\nThis example, uses Kubernetes secrets and assumes that the Broker UAIs run in the uas Kubernetes namespace. If a different namespace is used, the creation of the ConfigMaps is different but the contents are the same. Using a namespace other than uas for Broker UAIs has implications beyond secrets and configmaps, is not recommended and is beyond the scope of this document.\n  Configure LDAP and determine which files need to be changed in the Broker UAI and what their contents should be.\nIn this example, the file is /etc/sssd/sssd.conf and its contents are representative but sanitized. Substitute your own site specific contents:\n[sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam domains = My_DC [nss] filter_users = root filter_groups = root [pam] [domain/My_DC] ldap_search_base=dc=datacenter,dc=mydomain,dc=com ldap_uri=ldap://10.1.1.5,ldap://10.1.2.5 id_provider = ldap ldap_tls_reqcert = allow ldap_schema = rfc2307 cache_credentials = True entry_cache_timeout = 60 enumerate = False   Add the content from the previous step to a secret.\n  Create a file with the appropriate content.\nncn-m001-pit# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt;

Two important things to notice here are:\n The secret is mounted on the directory /etc/sssd not the file /etc/sssd/sssd.conf because Kubernetes does not permit the replacement of an existing regular file with a volume but does allow overriding a directory The value 384 is used here for the default mode of the file instead of 0600, which would be easier to read, because JSON does not accept octal numbers in the leading zero form    Make a volume to hold an empty and writable /etc/sssd/conf.d in the Broker UAI:\nncn-m001# cray uas admin config volumes create --mount-path /etc/sssd/conf.d --volume-description '{\u0026quot;empty_dir\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;medium\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Memory\u0026quot;}}' --volumename sssd-conf-d --format yaml Example output:\nmount_path: /etc/sssd/conf.d volume_description: empty_dir: medium: Memory volume_id: 541980f9-fadc-41cd-8222-e2ffdb6421c4 volumename: sssd-conf-d   Obtain the information needed to create a UAI class for the Broker UAI containing the updated configuration in the volume list.\nThe image-id of the Broker UAI image, the volume-ids of the volumes to be added to the broker class, and the class-id of the End-User UAI class managed by the broker are required:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config images list Example output:\n[[results]] default = true image_id = \u0026quot;1996c7f7-ca45-4588-bc41-0422fe2a1c3d\u0026quot;

This will be used to set up credentials within the UAI for the owner when the owner logs into the UAI. --publickey-str '\u0026lt;public-ssh-key\u0026gt;' - Specify the SSH public key that will be used to authenticate with the UAI. The key should be, for example, the contents of an id_rsa.pub file used by SSH. --uai-name TEXT - Specify an optional name to be assigned to the UAI on creation. If this is not specified, a default name of the form \u0026lt;owner\u0026gt;-uai-\u0026lt;short-uuid\u0026gt; is used. The UAI name is used both as the name of the UAI in the UAS and as the external DNS hostname of a publicly accessible UAI. If the requested UAI name is the same as an already existing UAI, no new UAI is created, but the information about the existing UAI is returned.

Refer to Elements of a UAI for descriptions of the volume configuration fields and values.\nNote the following caveats about adding volumes to UAS:\n A volume description may specify an underlying directory that is NFS-mounted on the UAI host nodes. Hard-mounted NFS file systems will stop responding indefinitely on references to their mount points if the NFS server fails or becomes unreachable from the UAI host node. This will cause new UAI creation and migration of existing UAIs to stop responding as well until the NFS issue is remedied. Multiple volumes can be configured in UAS with the same mount_path. UAS cannot create a UAI if that UAI has more than one volume specified for a given mount_path. If multiple volumes with the same mount_path exist in the UAS configuration all UAIs must be created using UAI classes that specify a workable subset of volumes. A UAI created without a UAI Class under such a UAS configuration will try to use all configured volumes and creation will fail. The volumename is a string that can describe or name the volume. It must be composed of only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes ('-'). The volumename also must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. As with UAI images, registering a volume with UAS creates the configuration that will be used to create a UAI. If the underlying object referred to by the volume does not exist at the time the UAI is created, the UAI will, in most cases, wait until the object becomes available before starting up. This will be visible in the UAI state which will eventually move to and remain in Waiting until the underlying issue is resolved.

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode\nBroker Mode UAI Management A Broker UAI is a special kind of UAI whose job is not to host users directly but to accept attempts to reach a UAI, locate or create a UAI for the user making the attempt, and then pass the user\u0026rsquo;s connection on to the correct UAI. Multiple Broker UAIs can be created, each serving users with UAIs of a different classes. This makes it possible to set up UAIs for varying workflows and environments as needed. The following illustrates a system using the Broker mode of UAI management:\nUnlike in the Legacy Mode, in the Broker Mode users log into their UAIs through the Broker UAI. The logic in the Broker UAI authenticates the user and assigns the user an End-User UAI. The Broker UAI then forwards the SSH session to the End-User UAI. This is seamless from the user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, as the SSH session is carried through the Broker UAI and into the End-User UAI.\nTo make all of this work, the administrator must define at least one UAI Class containing the configuration for the End-User UAIs to be created by the Broker UAI and one UAI class containing the Broker UAI configuration itself. The Broker UAI should be configured by the site to permit authentication of users. Refer to the example in Configure a Broker UAI Class for more information. The necessary Broker UAI customization can be achieved using volumes to place configuration files as needed in the file system namespace of the Broker UAI. Finally, once all of this is prepared, the administrator launches the Broker UAI, and makes the IP address of the Broker UAI available for users to log into.\nNext Topic: Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode\n"

	"content": "Top: User Access Service (UAS)\nNext Topic: Setting End-User UAI Timeouts\nChoosing UAI Resource Settings The Resource Specifications and UAI Classes sections describe how to set up resource specifications to be used with UAIs. Refer to those sections for all procedures and specific data structures associated with resources. In this section the question of how and why to configure UAI resources is addressed. While Kubernetes resource requests and limits can be used for other things, this section focuses on memory requests and limits and CPU requests and limits. Other resource types are outside the scope of this discussion.\nBefore discussing why custom resource specifications might be used, it is worthwhile to understand how Kubernetes behaves with respect to resources.\nKubernetes uses resource requests and limits on all of its pods (a UAI is, at its most basic, a Kubernetes pod) to determine where and whether to schedule the pod. Kubernetes will not schedule work on a host node if the pod containing that work requests more CPU or memory (or any other resource) than the host node has available. Once a request for resources has been granted by the scheduler, and the pod (UAI in this case) has been scheduled there, the available resources on the host node are reduced by the requested amount. It is possible for a resource specification to set a high limit and a low request, in which case many pods (UAIS) may be scheduled on the available host nodes. In this case, there is a risk of oversubscription as these pods grow into their limits. When Kubernetes detects resource pressure on a host node, it starts evicting pods from that node. If Kubernetes can find another host node with available space, it will reschedule an evicted pod (UAI) on that node. If not, the pod will remain evicted until a host node with sufficient resources becomes available.\nThe most common reason to set custom resource limits on a class of UAIs is that the workflows within those UAIs are more computationally or memory intensive than the default namespace resources support. In this case, the site should determine what the bottleneck is (memory or CPU) and experiment with larger settings. Note that by increasing a resource request or limit on a UAI Class you decrease the capacity of the UAI host nodes for UAIs of that class. Also note that, while it may be tempting to set low request values and higher limit values, the resulting potential oversubscription of nodes can make UAIs unstable and difficult to use.\nAnother reason for setting custom resource limits on a class of UAIs is that the UAIs are very lightweight and do not need the default namespace resource requests / limits. This can increase the capacity of the pool of available UAI host nodes, for UAIs of that class. The caveat here is that Kubernetes will terminate any pod (UAI) that tries to grow past its resource limits. Making the resource limits on UAI Classes too small can lead to instability of UAIs of that class.\nNext Topic: Setting End-User UAI Timeouts\n"

	"content": "Post-Install Customizations Post-install customizations may be needed as systems scale. These customizations also need to persist across future installs or upgrades. Not all resources can be customized post-install; common scenarios are documented in the following sections.\nThe following is a guide for determining where issues may exist, how to adjust the resources, and how to ensure the changes will persist. Different values may be be needed for systems as they scale.\nKubectl Events OOMKilled Check to see if there are any recent out of memory events.\n  Check kubectl events to see if there are any recent out of memory events.\nncn# kubectl get event -A | grep OOM   Use the Grafana \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Pod\u0026rdquo; Dashboard to view the memory utilization graphs over time for any pod that has been OOMKilled.\n  Prometheus CPUThrottlingHigh Alerts Check Prometheus for recent CPUThrottlingHigh Alerts.\n  From Prometheus (https://prometheus.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME/), select the Alert tab and scroll down to the alert for CPUThrottlingHigh.\n  Use the Grafana \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Pod\u0026rdquo; Dashboard to view the throttling graphs over time for any pod that is alerting.\n  Grafana Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Pod Dashboard Use Grafana to investigate and analyze CPU Throttling and/or Memory Usage.\n  From Grafana (https://grafana.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME/) and the Home Dashboard, select the \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes/Compute Resources/Pod\u0026rdquo; Dashboard.\n  Select the datasource, namespace, and pod based on the pod being examined. For example:\ndatasource: default namespace: sysmgmt-health pod: prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0   For CPU Throttling   Select the CPU Throttling drop-down to see the CPU Throttling graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right), and select the container (from the legends under the x axis).\n  The presence of CPU throttling does not always indicate a problem, but if a service is being slow or experiencing latency issues, reviewing the graph and adjusting the resources.limits.cpu can be beneficial. If the pod is being throttled at or near 100% for any period of time, then adjustments are likely needed. If the service\u0026rsquo;s response time is critical, then adjusting the pod\u0026rsquo;s resources to greatly reduce or eliminate any CPU throttling may be required.\n  The resources.requests.cpu are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to decide which node to place the pod on and do not impact CPU Throttling. The resources.limits.cpu can never be lower than the resources.requests.cpu.\n  For Memory Usage   Select the Memory Usage drop-down to see the Memory Usage graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right), and select the container (from the legends under the x axis).\n  From the Memory Usage graph for the container, determine the steady state memory usage. This is where the resources.requests.memory should be minimally set. But more importantly, determine the spike usage for the container and set the resources.limits.memory based on the spike values with some additional headroom.\n  Common Customization Scenarios  Prerequisite Prometheus Pod is OOMKilled or CPU Throttled Postgres Pods are OOMKilled or CPU Throttled Scale cray-bss Service Postgres PVC Resize  Prerequisite In order to apply post-install customizations to a system, the affected Helm chart must exist on the system so that the same chart version can be redeployed with the desired customizations.\nThis example unpacks the the csm-1.0.0 tarball under /root and lists the Helm charts that are now on your system. Set PATH_TO_RELEASE to the release directory where the Helm directory exists. PATH_TO_RELEASE will be used below when deploying a customization.\nThese unpacked files can be safely removed after the customizations are deployed through loftsman ship in the examples below.\n## This example assumes the csm-1.0.0 release is currently running and the csm-1.0.0.tar.gz has been pulled down under /root ncn# cd /root ncn# tar -xzf csm-1.0.0.tar.gz ncn# rm csm-1.0.0.tar.gz ncn# PATH_TO_RELEASE=/root/csm-1.0.0 ncn# ls $PATH_TO_RELEASE/helm Prometheus Pod is OOMKilled or CPU Throttled Update resources associated with Prometheus in the sysmgmt-health namespace.

	"content": "Remove Artifacts from Product Installations Remove product artifacts that were imported from various Cray products. These instructions provide guidance for removing Image Management Service (IMS) images, IMS recipes, and Git repositories present in the Cray Product Catalog from the system.\nThe examples in this procedure show how to remove the product artifacts for the Cray System Management (CSM) product.\nWARNING: If individual Cray products have removal procedures, those instructions supersede this procedure.\nProcedure   View the imported artifacts by printing them from the Cray Product Catalog ConfigMap.\nncn-m001# kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o json | jq -r .data.csm Example output:\n1.0.0: configuration: clone_url: https://vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git commit: 123264ba75c809c0db7742ea83ff57f713bc1562 import_branch: cray/csm/1.4.5 import_date: 2021-03-12 15:12:49.938936 ssh_url: git@vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME:cray/csm-config-management.git images: cray-shasta-csm-sles15sp1-barebones.x86_64-shasta-1.4: id: 4871cb4a-e055-4131-a228-c0a26f0903cd recipes: cray-shasta-csm-sles15sp1-barebones.x86_64-shasta-1.4: id: 5f5a74e0-108e-4159-9699-47dd2a952205   Remove the imported IMS images using the ID of each image in the images mapping.\nThe example in step 1 includes one image with the id = 4871cb4a-e055-4131-a228-c0a26f0903cd value. Remove the image with the following command:\nncn-m001# cray ims images delete 4871cb4a-e055-4131-a228-c0a26f0903cd   Remove the imported IMS recipes using the ID of each recipe in the recipes mapping.\nThe example in step 1 includes one recipe with the id = 5f5a74e0-108e-4159-9699-47dd2a952205 value. Remove the image with the following command:\nncn-m001# cray ims recipes delete 5f5a74e0-108e-4159-9699-47dd2a952205   Remove the Gitea repositories or branches.\nTo delete a Git branch as specified in the product catalog, follow the external instructions to delete Git remote branches. The branch name is located in the import_branch field.\nIf only one version of the product exists (as in the CSM example), the user can remove the entire repository instead of a single branch. Gitea repositories can be removed via the Gitea web interface or via the Gitea REST API.\nGitea web interface:\n1. Log in to Gitea as the *crayvcs* user. 1. From the dashboard, select the repository to delete based on the name of the repository in the *clone_url* field of the product catalog. 2. Click on \u0026quot;Settings\u0026quot; and scroll to the bottom of the page to the \u0026quot;Danger Zone\u0026quot; section. Follow the instructions to delete the repository.  Gitea REST API:\nRun the following commands on a CSM Kubernetes master or worker node, replacing the name of the repository in the second command.\nncn-m001# VCSPWD=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials \\ --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode) ncn-m001# curl -X DELETE -u crayvcs:${VCSPWD} \\ https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/api/v1/repos/cray/{name of repository}   Update the product catalog.\nOnce the images, recipes, and repositories/branches have been removed from the system, update the product catalog to remove the references to them. This is done by editing the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap.\nncn-m001# kubectl edit configmap -n services cray-product-catalog In the editor, delete the entries for the artifacts that were deleted on the system for the specific version of the product. In this example, all artifacts were deleted and only a single product version exists, so the entire entry in the product catalog for the CSM product can be deleted. Save the changes and exit the editor to persist the changes in the ConfigMap.\n  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Configure Non-Compute Nodes with CFS Non-compute node (NCN) personalization applies post-boot configuration to the HPE Cray EX management nodes. Several HPE Cray EX product environments outside of CSM require NCN personalization to function. Consult the manual for each product to configure them on NCNs by referring to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center.\nThis procedure defines the NCN personalization process for the CSM product using the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nSet Up Passwordless SSH This procedure should be run during CSM installation and afterwards whenever the SSH keys need to be changed per site requirements.\nThe goal of passwordless SSH is to enable an easy way for interactive passwordless SSH from and between CSM product environments (management nodes) to downstream managed product environments (COS, UAN, etc), without requiring each downstream environment to create and apply individual changes to NCNs, and as a primary way to manage passwordless SSH configuration between management nodes. Passwordless SSH from downstream nodes into CSM management nodes is not intended or supported.\nPasswordless SSH keypairs for the Cray System Management (CSM) are created automatically and maintained with a Kubernetes deployment and staged into Kubernetes secrets (csm-private-key) and ConfigMaps (csm-public-key) in the services namespace. Administrators can use these provided keys, provide their own keys, or use their own solution for authentication.\nThe management of keys on NCNs is achieved by the trust-csm-ssh-keys and passwordless-ssh Ansible roles in the CSM configuration management repository. The SSH keypair is applied to management nodes via NCN personalization.\nOption 1: Use the CSM-provided SSH Keys The default CSM Ansible plays are already configured to enable Passwordless SSH by default. No further action is necessary before running NCN personalization with CFS.\nOption 2: Provide Custom SSH Keys Administrators may elect to replace the CSM-provided keys with their own custom keys. The replace_ssh_keys.sh script can be used to replace the keys from files.\nncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/configuration/replace_ssh_keys.sh \\ --public-key-file ./id_rsa-csm.pub --private-key-file ./id_rsa-csm Alternatively, the keys stored in Kubernetes can be updated directly.\n  Replace the private key half:\nncn# kubectl get secret -n services csm-private-key -o json | jq --arg value \u0026#34;$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa-csm | base64)\u0026#34; \u0026#39;.data[\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;]=$value\u0026#39; | kubectl apply -f - where ~/.ssh/id_rsa-csm is a local file containing a valid SSH private key.\n  Replace the public key half:\nncn# kubectl delete configmap -n services csm-public-key \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa-csm.pub | \\  base64 \u0026gt; ./value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; kubectl create configmap --from-file \\  value csm-public-key --namespace services \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm ./value where ~/.ssh/id_rsa-csm.pub is a local file containing a valid public key intended for CSM and downstream products.\n  Passwordless SSH with the provided keys will be set up once NCN personalization runs on the NCNs.\nNOTE: This key pair may or may not be the same key pair used for the NCN root user. See the Configure the Root Password and Root SSH Keys in Vault procedure below for setting the root user SSH keys on NCNs.\nOption 3: Disable CSM-provided Passwordless SSH Local site security requirements may preclude use of passwordless SSH access between management nodes. A variable has been added to the associated ansible roles that will allow you to disable passwordless SSH setup to any or all nodes. From the cloned csm-config-management repository directory:\n``` ncn# grep csm_passwordless_ssh_enabled roles/trust-csm-ssh-keys/defaults/main.yaml ``` Example output: ``` csm_passwordless_ssh_enabled: 'false' ```  This variable can be overwritten using either a host-specific setting or \u0026lsquo;global\u0026rsquo; to affect all nodes where the playbook is run. Please reference Customize Configuration Values for more detailed information. Do not modify the value in the roles/trust-csm-ssh-keys/defaults/main.yaml file.\nPublished roles within product configuration repositories can contain more comprehensive information regarding these role-specific flags. Please reference any role specific associated Readme.md documents for additional information, as role documentation is updated more frequently as changes are introduced.\nConsult the manual for each product to change the default configuration by referring to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center. Similar configuration values for disabling the role will be required in these product specific configuration repositories.\nModifying Ansible plays in a configuration repository will require a new commit and subsequent update of the configuration layer associated with the product.\n NOTE: CFS itself does not use the CSM-provided (or user-supplied) SSH keys to make connections between nodes. CFS will continue to function if passwordless SSH is disabled between CSM and other product environments.\n Restore CSM-provided SSH Keys  Use this procedure if switching from custom keys to the default CSM SSH keys only, otherwise it can be skipped.\n To restore the default CSM keys, administrators can run the restore_ssh_keys.sh script.\nncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/configuration/restore_ssh_keys.sh Alternatively, the keys can be deleted from Kubernetes directly. The csm-ssh-keys Kubernetes deployment provided by CSM periodically checks the ConfigMap and secret containing the key information. If these entries do not exist, it will recreate them from the default CSM keys. To manually restore keys, delete the associated ConfigMap and secret, and the default CSM-provided keys will be republished.\n Delete the csm-private-key Kubernetes secret. ncn# kubectl delete secret -n services csm-private-key  Delete the csm-public-key Kubernetes configmap. ncn# kubectl delete configmap -n services csm-public-key   Configure the Root Password and Root SSH Keys in Vault The root user password and SSH keys are managed on NCNs by using the csm.password and csm.ssh_keys Ansible roles, respectively, located in the CSM configuration management repository. Root user passwords and SSH keys are set and managed in Vault.\n Set the root user password in Vault by following the Configure Root Password in Vault procedure in Update NCN User Passwords. Set the root user SSH keys in Vault by following the Configure Root SSH Keys in Vault procedure in Update NCN User SSH Keys. Apply the Vault password to the NCNs in the Perform NCN personalization procedure.  Perform NCN Personalization After completing the previous procedures, apply the configuration to the NCNs by running NCN personalization with CFS. This can be accomplished by running the apply_csm_configuration.sh script, or running the steps manually. By default the script will select the latest available csm release. However for clarity it is recommended that the user provide the csm release using the --csm-release parameter. For more detailed information on the script, see Automatically Apply CSM Configuration to NCNs.\nncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/configuration/apply_csm_configuration.sh --csm-release \u0026lt;version e.g. 1.0.11\u0026gt; To manually run NCN personalization, first gather the following information:\n HTTP clone URL for the configuration repository in VCS Path to the Ansible play to run in the repository Commit ID in the repository for CFS to pull and run on the nodes.     Field Value Description     cloneUrl https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git CSM configuration repo   commit Example: 5081c1ecea56002df41218ee39f6030c3eebdf27 CSM configuration commit hash   name Example: csm-ncn-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt; CSM Configuration layer name   playbook site.yml Default site-wide Ansible playbook for CSM      Retrieve the commit in the repository to use for configuration. If changes have been made to the default branch that was imported during a CSM installation or upgrade, use the commit containing the changes.\n  If no changes have been made, the latest commit on the default branch for this version of CSM should be used. Find the commit in the cray-product-catalog for the current version of CSM. For example:\nncn# kubectl -n services get cm cray-product-catalog -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.csm}\u0026#39; 1.2.0: configuration: clone_url: https://vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git commit: 43ecfa8236bed625b54325ebb70916f55884b3a4 import_branch: cray/csm/1.9.24 import_date: 2021-07-28 03:26:01.869501 ssh_url: git@vcs.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME:cray/csm-config-management.git ...

Finds the CSM configuration version associated with the given release. Finds the latest commit on the release branch of the csm-config-management repo. Creates or updates the ncn-personalization.json configuration file. Finds all nodes in HSM with the Management role. Disables configuration for all NCNs. Updates the ncn-personalization configuration in CFS from the ncn-personalization.json file. Enables configuration for all NCN nodes, and sets their desired configuration to ncn-personalization. Monitors CFS until all NCN nodes have successfully completed, or failed, configuration.  Automatic CSM Configuration Overrides The script also supports several flags to override these behaviors:\n csm-release: Overrides the version of the CSM release that is used. Defaults to the latest version. Available versions can be found in the cray-product-catalog. ncn-m001# kubectl -n services get cm cray-product-catalog  csm-config-version: Overrides the version of the CSM configuration. This corresponds to the version of a branch starting with cray/csm/ in the csm repo in VCS. git-commit: Overrides the git commit cloned for the configuration content. Defaults to the latest commit on the csm-release branch. git-clone-url: Overrides the source of the configuration content. Defaults to https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git. ncn-config-file: Sets a file other than ncn-personalization.json to be used for the configuration. xnames: A comma-separated list of component names (xnames) to deploy to. Defaults to all Management nodes in HSM. clear-state: Clears existing state from components to ensure CFS runs. This can be used if configuration needs to be re-run on successful nodes with no change to the git content since the previous run. For examples, if the SSH keys have changed.  "

These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment via Helm charts. Kubernetes orchestrates these services and schedules them on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling increases or decreases the number of services' instances as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nThere is much more information available in the CSM Overview about the hardware, software, network, and access to these services and components.\nSee CSM Overview\nScenarios for Shasta v1.5 These scenarios for how to get CSM software onto a system are described in Scenarios for Shasta v1.5.\n Installation of CSM software  First time installation of CSM software Reinstall of CSM software   Upgrade from a previous version of CSM software  Note: A migration from Shasta v1.3.x software to Shasta v1.5 software is not supported as a direct action, but is a two step process of first migrating from Shasta v1.3.x to Shasta v1.4 and then following the Upgrade procedure from v1.4 to v1.5.\nSee Scenarios for Shasta v1.5\nCSM Product Stream Updates The software included in the CSM product stream is released in more than one way. The initial product release may be augmented with late-breaking documentation updates or hotfixes after the release.\nSee CSM Product Stream Updates\nCSM Operational Activities Procedures which are used during either installation, upgrading or general operation of the system reside here.

Consult the manual for each product to configure them on NCNs by referring to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center.\nProcedure: Perform NCN Personalization Determine if NCN Personalization CFS Configuration Exists If upgrading a product to a new version, an NCN personalization configuration in CFS should already exist. By default, the configuration is named ncn-personalization. If the default name is not used, substitute that name in the steps below.\n  Determine if a configuration already exists.\nncn# cray cfs configurations describe ncn-personalization --format json \u0026gt; ncn-personalization.json   If the configuration exists, the ncn-personalization.json file will be created and populated with previously defined configuration layers. If it does not exist, the file will be created empty and the command will respond with an error. This error can be ignored.\nAdd Layer(s) to the CFS Configuration CFS executes configuration layers in order. Refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg to determine if the configuration layer requires special placement in the layer list.\n NOTE: The CSM configuration layer MUST be the first layer in the NCN personalization CFS configuration.\n  Add a configuration layer to the ncn-personalization.json file. Follow the appropriate step based on if an NCN personalization CFS configuration exists:   If the ncn-personalization.json file is empty, overwrite the file with the configuration layer(s) information gathered from the product that is configuring the NCNs. Use the sample file with a single layer as a template.\n  If a CFS configuration exists with one or more layers, add (or replace) the corresponding layer entry(ies) with the configuration layer information gathered for this specific product.

	"content": "Scenarios for Shasta v1.5 There are multiple scenarios for installing CSM software which are described in this documentation with many supporting procedures.\n Scenarios for Shasta v1.5  Installation Upgrade Migration    Installation There are two ways to install the CSM software. There are some differences between a first time install which must create the initial configuration payload and configure the management network switches, whereas a reinstall can reuse a previous configuration payload and skip the configuration of management network switches. The first time install will check and then may update firmware for various components whereas the reinstall will check and indicate that no firmware update is required. There are two different ways to use the LiveCD, either from a RemoteISO or a USB device, which are described in Bootstrap PIT Node. There are a few places where a comment will be made in a procedure for how one of the scenarios needs to do something differently.\n  First time Install\n Prepare Configuration Payload creates the initial configuration payload. Bootstrap PIT Node Configure Management Network Switches    Reinstall\n Prepare Configuration Payload can reuse a previous configuration payload. There may be additional steps to manually wipe disks on the management nodes and do other actions to prepare the management node hardware for the reinstall. Bootstrap PIT Node Can skip the procedure to Configure Management Network Switches    The two paths merge together after configuration of the management network switches to do later actions the same regardless of the starting point in the workflow.\n Deploy Management Nodes Install CSM Services Validate CSM Health Before Final NCN Deployment Deploy Final NCN Configure Administrative Access Validate CSM Health Update Firmware with FAS Prepare Compute Nodes  After completion of the firmware update with FAS and the preparation of compute nodes, the CSM product stream has been fully installed and configured. Refer to the HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg for more information on other product streams to be installed and configured after CSM.\nSee Install CSM for the details on the installation process for either a first time install or a reinstall.\nUpgrade The upgrade from Shasta v1.4.2 (including CSM 0.9.3) to Shasta v1.5 (including CSM 1.0) is supported. This process will upgrade the Ceph storage software, then the storage nodes, then the Kubernetes master nodes and worker nodes, and finally the CSM services. The management nodes are upgraded using a rolling upgrade approach which enables management services to continue to function even as one or a few nodes are being upgraded.\nSee Upgrade CSM.\nMigration There is no direct migration from Shasta v1.3.x releases to Shasta v1.5. However, there is a supported path.\n  Migration from v1.3.x to v1.4.0\nThe migration from v1.3.x to v1.4.0 is described in the Shasta v1.4 documentation. Refer to \u0026ldquo;1.3 to 1.4 Install Prerequisites\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Collect Data From Healthy Shasta 1.3 System for EX 1.4 Installation\u0026rdquo; in the HPE Cray EX System Installation and Configuration Guide 1.4 S-8000.\n  Upgrade v1.4.x to v1.5\nAn upgrade from the previous release (Shasta v1.4.x) is supported with this release.\nSee Upgrade from 1.4.x to v1.5\n  "

HSM now has a v2 REST API NCN user password and SSH key management is available for both root and non-root users via NCN personalization. Please refer to Configure Non-Compute Nodes with CFS.  Deprecated Features The following features are no longer supported and are planned to be removed in a future release:\n HSM v1 REST API has been deprecated as of CSM version 0.9.3. The v1 HSM APIs will be removed in the CSM version 1.3 release. Many CAPMC v1 REST API and CLI features are being deprecated as part of CSM version 1.0; Full removal of the deprecated CAPMC features will happen in CSM version 1.3. Further development of CAPMC service or CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release. The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC are being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS. More information about PCS and the CAPMC transition will be released as part of subsequent CSM releases. HMNFD v1 REST API has been deprecated as of CSM version 1.2. The v1 HMNFD APIs will be removed in the CSM version 1.5 release.  For more information on what features have been deprecated please view the CAPMC swagger doc or read the CAPMC deprecation notice   The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) API is changing in the upcoming CSM-1.2.0 release:  The --template-body option for the Cray CLI bos command will be deprecated. Performing a GET on the session status for a boot set (i.e. /v1/session/{session_id}/status/{boot_set_name}) currently returns a status code of 201, but instead it should return a status code of 200. This will be corrected to return 200.   The Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) will be deprecated in the CSM-1.3.0 release. Enhanced BOS functionality will replace CRUS. This includes the ability to stage changes to nodes that can be acted upon later when the node reboots. It also includes the ability to reboot nodes without specifying any boot artifacts. This latter ability relies on the artifacts already having been staged.  Removed Features The following features have been completely removed:\n cray-conman pod. This has been replaced by cray-console-node. CFS v1 API and CLI. The v2 API/CLI has been the default since CSM 0.9 (Shasta 1.4).  Other Changes "

	"content": "Documentation Conventions Several conventions have been used in the preparation of this documentation.\n Markdown Format File Formats Typographic Conventions Command Prompt Conventions which describe the context for user, host, directory, chroot environment, or container environment  Markdown Format This documentation is in Markdown format. Although much of it can be viewed with any text editor, a richer experience will come from using a tool which can render the Markdown to show different font sizes, the use of bold and italics formatting, inclusion of diagrams and screen shots as image files, and to follow navigational links within a topic file and to other files.\nThere are many tools which render the Markdown format and provide these advantages. Any Internet search for Markdown tools will provide a long list of these tools. Some of the tools are better than others at displaying the images and allowing you to follow the navigational links.\nFile Formats Some of the installation instructions require updating files in JSON, YAML, or TOML format. These files should be updated with care because some file formats do not accept tab characters for indentation of lines. Only space characters are supported. Refer to online documentation to learn more about the syntax of JSON, YAML, and TOML files. YAML does not support tab characters. The JSON convention is to use four spaces rather than a tab character.\nTypographic Conventions This style indicates program code, reserved words, library functions, command-line prompts, screen output, file/path names, and other software constructs.\n\\ (backslash) At the end of a command line, indicates the Linux shell line continuation character (lines joined by a backslash are parsed as a single line).\nCommand Prompt Conventions Host name and account in command prompts The host name in a command prompt indicates where the command must be run. The account that must run the command is also indicated in the prompt.\n The root or super-user account always has the # character at the end of the prompt Any non-root account is indicated with account@hostname. A non-privileged account is referred to as user.  Node abbreviations The following list contains abbreviations for nodes used below\n CN - compute Node NCN - Non-Compute Node AN - Application Node (special type of NCN) UAN - User Access Node (special type of AN) PIT - Pre-Install Toolkit (initial node used as the inception node during software installation booted from the LiveCD)     Prompt Description     ncn# Run the command as root on any NCN, except an NCN which is functioning as an Application Node (AN), such as a UAN.   ncn-m# Run the command as root on any NCN-M (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node).   ncn-m002# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-M (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node) which has this hostname (ncn-m002).   ncn-w# Run the command as root on any NCN-W (NCN which is a Kubernetes worker node).   ncn-w001# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-W (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node) which has this hostname (ncn-w001).   ncn-s# Run the command as root on any NCN-S (NCN which is a Utility Storage node).   ncn-s003# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-S (NCN which is a Utility Storage node) which has this hostname (ncn-s003).   pit# Run the command as root on the PIT node.   linux# Run the command as root on a Linux host.   uan# Run the command as root on any UAN.   uan01# Run the command as root on hostname uan01.   user@uan\u0026gt; Run the command as any non-root user on any UAN.   cn# Run the command as root on any CN. Note that a CN will have a hostname of the form nid124356, that is \u0026ldquo;nid\u0026rdquo; and a six digit, zero padded number.   hostname# Run the command as root on the specified hostname.   user@hostname\u0026gt; Run the command as any non-root user on the specified hostname.    Command prompt inside chroot If the chroot command is used, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside a chroot environment on the system.\nhostname# chroot /path/to/chroot chroot-hostname# Command prompt inside Kubernetes pod If executing a shell inside a container of a Kubernetes pod where the pod name is $podName, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside the pod. Not all shells are available within every pod, this is an example using a commonly available shell.\nncn# kubectl exec -it $podName /bin/sh pod# Command prompt inside image customization session If using SSH to access the image customization environment (pod) during an image customization session, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside this environment. This example uses $PORT and $HOST as environment variables with specific settings. When using chroot in this context, the prompt will be different than the above chroot example.\nhostname# ssh -p $PORT root@$HOST root@POD# chroot /mnt/image/image-root :/# Directory path in command prompt Example prompts do not include the directory path, because long paths can reduce the clarity of examples. Most of the time, the command can be executed from any directory. When it matters which directory the command is invoked within, the cd command is used to change into the directory, and the directory is referenced with a period (.) to indicate the current directory\nExamples of prompts as they appear on the system:\nhostname:~ # cd /etc hostname:/etc# cd /var/tmp hostname:/var/tmp# ls ./file hostname:/var/tmp# su - user user@hostname:~\u0026gt; cd /usr/bin user hostname:/usr/bin\u0026gt; ./command Examples of prompts as they appear in this publication:\nhostname # cd /etc hostname # cd /var/tmp hostname # ls ./file hostname # su - user user@hostname \u0026gt; cd /usr/bin user@hostname \u0026gt; ./command Command prompts for network switch configuration The prompts when doing network switch configuration can vary widely depending on which vendor switch is being configured and the context of the item being configured on that switch. There may be two levels of user privilege which have different commands available and a special command to enter configuration mode.\nExample of prompts as they appear in this publication:\nEnter \u0026ldquo;setup\u0026rdquo; mode for the switch make and model, for example:\nremote# ssh admin@sw-leaf-001 sw-leaf-001\u0026gt; enable sw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(conf)# Refer to the switch vendor OEM documentation for more information about configuring a specific switch.\n"

	"content": "CSM Overview This CSM Overview describes the Cray System Management ecosystem with its hardware, software, and network. It describes how to access these services and components.\nThe CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment via Helm charts. Kubernetes orchestrates these services and schedules them on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling increases or decreases the number of services' instances as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nTopics:  System Nodes and Networks Default IP Address Ranges Resilience of System Management Services Access to System Management Services  Details 1. System Nodes and Networks The HPE Cray EX system has two types of nodes:\n Compute Nodes, where high performance computing applications are run, have hostnames in the form of nidXXXXXX, that is, \u0026ldquo;nid\u0026rdquo; followed by six digits. These six digits will be padded with zeroes at the beginning. All other nodes provide supporting functions to these compute nodes. Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs), which carry out system functions and come in many types:  Management nodes in a Kubernetes cluster which host system services.  Kubernetes master nodes, with names in the form of ncn-mXXX. Every system has three or more master nodes. Kubernetes worker nodes, with names in the form of ncn-wXXX. Every system has three or more worker nodes. Utility Storage nodes providing Ceph storage to Kubernetes nodes, with names in the form of ncn-sXXX. Every system has three or more storage nodes.   Application nodes (ANs) which are not part of the Kubernetes management cluster  User Access Nodes (UANs), known by some as login or front-end nodes Other site-defined types:  Gateway nodes Data Mover nodes Visualization nodes        The following system networks connect the devices listed:\n Networks external to the system:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network ClusterStor System Management Unit (SMU) interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)     System networks:  Hardware Management Network (HMN)  BMCs for Admin tasks Power distribution units (PDU) Keyboard/video/mouse (KVM)   Node Management Network (NMN)  All NCNs and compute nodes   ClusterStor Management Network  ClusterStor controller management interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, Metadata Management Unit (MMU), and Scalable Storage Unit (SSU))   High-Speed Network (HSN), which connects the following devices:  Kubernetes worker nodes UANs ClusterStor controller data interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, MMU, and SSU)      During initial installation, several of those networks are created with default IP address ranges. See Default IP Address Ranges\nThe network management system (NMS) data model and REST API enable customer sites to construct their own \u0026ldquo;networks\u0026rdquo; of nodes within the high-speed fabric, where a \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; is a collection of nodes that share a VLAN and an IP subnet.\nThe low-level network management components (switch, DHCP service, ARP service) of the management nodes and ClusterStor interfaces are configured to serve one particular network (the \u0026ldquo;supported network\u0026rdquo;) on the high-speed fabric. As part of the initial installation, the supported network is created to include all of the compute nodes, thereby enabling those compute nodes to access the gateway, user access services, and ClusterStor devices.\nA site may create other networks as well, but it is only the supported network that is served by those devices.\n2. Default IP Address Ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These IP address default ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.\nThe following table shows the default IP address ranges\n   Network IP Address Range     Kubernetes service network 10.16.0.0/12   Kubernetes pod network 10.32.0.0/12   Install Network (MTL) 10.1.0.0/16   Node Management Network (NMN) 10.252.0.0/17   High Speed Network (HSN) 10.253.0.0/16   Hardware Management Network (HMN) 10.254.0.0/17   Mountain NMN Allocate a /22 from this range per liquid cooled cabinet: * cabinet 1 * cabinet 2 * cabinet 3 * \u0026hellip; 10.100.0.0/17 Example IP address in the allocated ranges: * 10.100.0.0/22 * 10.100.4.0/22 * 10.100.8.0/22 * \u0026hellip;   Mountain HMN Allocate a /22 from this range per liquid cooled cabinet: * cabinet 1 * cabinet 2 * cabinet 3 * \u0026hellip; 10.104.0.0/17 Example IP address in the allocated ranges: * 10.104.0.0/22 * 10.104.4.0/22 * 10.104.8.0/22 * \u0026hellip;   River NMN 10.106.0.0/17   River HMN 10.107.0.0/17   Load Balanced NMN     The above values could be modified prior to install if there is a need to ensure that there are no conflicts with customer resources, such as LDAP or license servers. If a customer has more than one HPE Cray EX system, these values can be safely reused across them all. Contact customer support for this site if it is required to change the IP address range for Kubernetes services or pods; for example, if the IP addresses within those ranges must be used for something else. The cluster must be fully reinstalled if either of those ranges are changed.\nThere are several network values and other pieces of system information that are unique to the customer system.\n  IP addresses and the network(s) for ncn-m001 and the BMC on ncn-m001.\n  The main Customer Access Network (CAN) subnet and the two address pools mentioned below need to be part of the main subnet.\nFor more information on the CAN, see Customer Access Network (CAN).\n Subnet for the MetalLB static address pool (can-static-pool), which is used for services that need to be pinned to the same IP address, such as the system DNS service. Subnet for the MetalLB dynamic address pool (can-dynamic-pool), which is used for services such as User Access Instances (UAIs) that can be reached by DNS.    HPE Cray EX Domain: The value of the subdomain that is used to access externally exposed services. For example, if the system is named TestSystem, and the site is example.com, the HPE Cray EX domain would be testsystem.example.com. Central DNS would need to be configured to delegate requests for addresses in this domain to the HPE Cray EX DNS IP address for resolution.\n  HPE Cray EX DNS IP: The IP address used for the HPE Cray EX DNS service. Central DNS delegates the resolution for addresses in the HPE Cray EX Domain to this server. The IP address will be in the can-static-pool subnet.\n  CAN gateway IP address: The IP address assigned to a specific port on the spine switch, which will act as the gateway between the CAN and the rest of the customer\u0026rsquo;s internal networks. This address would be the lasthop route to the CAN network.\n  3. Resilience of System Management Services HPE Cray EX systems are designed so that system management services (SMS) are fully resilient and that there is no single point of failure. The design of the system allows for resiliency in the following ways:\n Three management nodes are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. When one master goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes. When one of the utility storage nodes goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three management nodes are configured as Kubernetes worker nodes. If one of only three Kubernetes worker nodes were to go down, it would be much more difficult for the remaining two worker nodes to handle the total balance of pods. It is less significant to lose one of the worker nodes if the system has more than three worker nodes because there are more worker nodes able to handle the pod load. The state and configuration of the Kubernetes cluster are stored in an etcd cluster distributed across the Kubernetes master nodes. This cluster is also backed up on an interval, and backups are pushed to the local cluster\u0026rsquo;s Ceph Rados Gateway (S3). A micro-service can run on any node that meets the requirements for that micro-service, such as appropriate hardware attributes, which are indicated by Kubernetes labels and taints. All micro-services have shared persistent storage so that they can be restarted on any worker node in the Kubernetes management cluster without losing state.  Kubernetes is designed to ensure that the desired number of deployments of a micro-service are always running on one or more worker nodes. In addition, it ensures that if one worker node becomes unresponsive, the micro-services that were running on it are migrated to another worker node that is up and meets the requirements of those micro-services.\nFor more information about resiliency topics see Resilience of System Management Services.\n4. Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority. All services and the API gateway are not dependent on any single node. This resilient arrangement ensures that services remain available during possible underlying hardware and network failures.\nAccess to individual APIs through the gateway is controlled by a policy-driven access control system. Administrators and users must retrieve a token for authentication before attempting to access APIs through the gateway and present a valid token with each API call. The authentication and authorization decisions are made at the gateway level which prevent unauthorized API calls from reaching the underlying micro-services. For more detail on the process of obtaining tokens and user management, see System Security and Authentication.\nReview the API documentation in the supplied container before attempting to use the API services. This container is generated with the release using the most current API descriptions in OpenAPI 2.0 format. Because this file serves as both an internal definition of the API contract and the external documentation of the API function, it is the most up-to-date reference available.\nThe API Gateway URL for accessing the APIs on a site-specific system is https://api.cmn.SYSTEM-NAME.DOMAIN-NAME/apis/.\nThe internal URL from a local console on any of the management nodes is https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis.\n"

	"content": "Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation This page will detail how disks to wipe NCN disks.\n Everything in this section should be considered DESTRUCTIVE.\n After following these procedures an NCN can be rebooted and redeployed.\nAll types of disk wipe can be run from Linux or an initramFS/initrd emergency shell.\nThe following are potential use cases for wiping disks:\n\n Adding a node that is not bare. Adopting new disks that are not bare. Doing a fresh install.  Topics:  Basic Wipe Advanced Wipe Full Wipe  1. Basic Wipe A basic wipe includes wiping the disks and all of the RAIDs. These basic wipe instructions can be executed on any management nodes (master, worker, and storage).\n  List the disks for verification.\nncn# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*   Wipe the disks and the RAIDs.\nncn# wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/* If any disks had labels present, output looks similar to the following:\n/dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54 /dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54 /dev/sda: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000000 (crypto_LUKS): 4c 55 4b 53 ba be /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00004000 (crypto_LUKS): 53 4b 55 4c ba be /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54 /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54 /dev/sdc: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa Verify there are no error messages in the output.\nThe wipefs command may fail if no labeled disks are found, which is an indication of a larger problem.\n  2. Advanced Wipe This section is specific to utility storage nodes. An advanced wipe includes deleting the Ceph volumes and then wiping the disks and RAIDs.\n  Delete Ceph volumes.\nncn-s# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running after running the first command.\nncn-s# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/* ncn-s# vgremove -f -v --select \u0026#39;vg_name=~ceph*\u0026#39;   List the disks for verification.\nncn# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*   Wipe the disks and RAIDs.\nncn-s# wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/* See Basic Wipe section for expected output from the wipefs command.\n  3. Full-Wipe This section is the preferred method for all nodes. A full wipe includes deleting the Ceph volumes (where applicable), stopping the RAIDs, zeroing the disks, and then wiping the disks and RAIDs.\nIMPORTANT: Pay attention to whether the command is to be run on a worker node, master node, or storage node. If a node type is not specified, the step should be run regardless of node type.\n  Reset Kubernetes on worker nodes ONLY.\nThis will stop kubelet, underlying containers, and remove the contents of /var/lib/kubelet.\n  Reset Kubernetes.\nncn-w# kubeadm reset --force   List any containers running in containerd.\nncn-w# crictl ps CONTAINER IMAGE CREATED STATE NAME ATTEMPT POD ID 66a78adf6b4c2 18b6035f5a9ce About a minute ago Running spire-bundle 1212 6d89f7dee8ab6 7680e4050386d c8344c866fa55 24 hours ago Running speaker 0 5460d2bffb4d7 b6467c907f063 8e6730a2b718c 3 days ago Running request-ncn-join-token 0 a3a9ca9e1ca78 e8ce2d1a8379f 64d4c06dc3fb4 3 days ago Running istio-proxy 0 6d89f7dee8ab6 c3d4811fc3cd0 0215a709bdd9b 3 days ago Running weave-npc 0 f5e25c12e617e   If there are any running containers from the output of the crictl ps command, stop them.\nncn-w# crictl stop \u0026lt;container id from the CONTAINER column\u0026gt;     Reset Kubernetes on master nodes ONLY.\nThis will stop kubelet, underlying containers, and remove the contents of /var/lib/kubelet.\n  Reset Kubernetes.\nncn-m# kubeadm reset --force   List any containers running in containerd.\nncn-m# crictl ps CONTAINER IMAGE CREATED STATE NAME ATTEMPT POD ID 66a78adf6b4c2 18b6035f5a9ce About a minute ago Running spire-bundle 1212 6d89f7dee8ab6 7680e4050386d c8344c866fa55 24 hours ago Running speaker 0 5460d2bffb4d7 b6467c907f063 8e6730a2b718c 3 days ago Running request-ncn-join-token 0 a3a9ca9e1ca78 e8ce2d1a8379f 64d4c06dc3fb4 3 days ago Running istio-proxy 0 6d89f7dee8ab6 c3d4811fc3cd0 0215a709bdd9b 3 days ago Running weave-npc 0 f5e25c12e617e   If there are any running containers from the output of the crictl ps command, stop them.\nncn-m# crictl stop \u0026lt;container id from the CONTAINER column\u0026gt;     Delete Ceph Volumes on utility storage nodes ONLY.\n  For each storage node:\n  Stop Ceph.\n  1.4 or earlier\nncn-s# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target   1.5 or later\nncn-s# cephadm rm-cluster --fsid $(cephadm ls|jq -r \u0026#39;.[0].fsid\u0026#39;) --force     Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running.\n  1.4 or earlier\nncn-s# ps -ef|grep ceph-osd   1.5 or later\nncn-s# podman ps   Examine the output.

If any drives are still listed, remove them with pvremove, but this is rarely needed. Also, if the above command fails or returns a warning about the filesystem being in use, ignore the error and proceed to the next step, as this will not inhibit the wipe process.\n   Group these commands together for each node.\nThis group of commands should be done in succession on one node before moving to do the same set of commands on the next node. The nodes would be addressed in descending order for each type of node.

This information is required by CSM to perform hardware discovery and geolocation of air-cooled hardware in the system. The HMN tab may contain other hardware that is not managed by CSM, but is connected to the HMN.\nThe hmn_connections.json file is derived from the HMN tab of a system SHCD, and is one of the seed files required by Cray Site Init (CSI) command to generate configuration files required to install CSM. The hmn_connections.json file is almost a 1 to 1 copy of the right-hand table in the HMN tab of the SHCD. It is an array of JSON objects, and each object represents a row from the HMN tab. Any row that is not understood by CSI will be ignored, this includes any additional devices connected to the HMN that are not managed by CSM.\nThe System Layout Service (SLS) contains data about what hardware is in the system and how it is connected to the HMN network. This data is generated when the CSI tool generates configurations files for system. For air-cooled hardware, SLS will contain the SLS representation of the device and a Management Switch Connector object that describes what device is plugged into a particular management switch port.\nColumn mapping from SHCD to hmn_connections.json:\n   SHCD Column SHCD Column Name hmn_connections Field Description     J20 Source Source Name of the device connected to the HMN network   K20 Rack SourceRack Source Rack, matches regex x\\d+   L20 Location SourceLocation For nodes (Management, Compute, Application), this is bottom most rack slot that the node occupies, and can be extracted by [a-zA-Z]*(\\d+)([a-zA-Z]*). For other device types this is ignored.   M20  SourceSubLocation For compute nodes, this can be L, l, R, r, or blank. For other device types this is ignored.   N20 Parent SourceParent    O20  not used    P20 Port not used    Q20 Destination not used    R20 Rack DestinationRack Rack of the management switch   S20 Location DestinationLocation Rack slot of the management switch   T20  not used    U20 Port DestinationPort Switch port on the management switch     Only J20 needs to have the column name of Source. There are no requirements on what the other columns should be named.\n Some conventions for this document:\n All Source names from the SHCD are lowercased before being processed by the CSI tool. Throughout this document the Field names from the hmn_connections.json file will be used to referenced values from the SHCD. Each device type has an example of how it is represented in the HMN tab of the SHCD, the hmn_connections.json file, and lastly in SLS.  Compute Node The Source field needs to match these conditions to be considered a compute node:\n Has the prefix of:  nid cn   Source field contains ends with an integer that matches this regex: (\\d+$)  This is integer is the Node ID (NID) for the node Each node should have a unique NID value    The following are valid source fields for example:\n nid000001 cn1 cn-01  Depending the type of compute node additional rules may apply. Compute nodes in the follow sections will use the nid prefix.\nDense 4 node chassis - Gigabyte or Intel chassis  Apollo 2000 compute nodes are not currently supported by CSM\n Air-cooled compute nodes are typically in a 2U chassis that contains 4 compute nodes. Each of the compute nodes in the chassis gets its own row in the HMN tab, plus a parent row.\nThe value of the SourceParent field is used to group together the 4 nodes that are contained within the same chassis, and it is used to reference another row in the SHCD HMN table. The referenced SourceParent row is used to determine the rack slot that the compute nodes in occupy.\n The SourceParent row can be a Chassis Management Controller which can be used to control devices underneath it. This device typically will have a connection to the HMN. A Gigabyte CMC is an example of a CMC. If a CMC is not connected to the HMN network, this will prevent CSM services from managing that device. The SourceParent row can be a virtual parent that is used to group the compute nodes together symbolically into a chassis. Does not need to not have a connection to the HMN.  The rack slot that a compute node occupies is determined by the Rack Slot of the SourceParent. The SourceLocation of the parent is the bottom most U of the chassis. The component name (xname) that is given to the 4 nodes in the same chassis used by the HMS/SLS services specify that all of the computes are in the same rack U (bottommost U of the chassis)\nThe BMC ordinal for the nodes BMC is derived from the NID of the node, by applying a modulo of 4 plus 1. For example, the node with NID 17 in slot 10 in cabinet 3000 will have the component name (xname) of x3000s10b2n0/\nSHCD Example 4 compute nodes in the same chassis with a CMC connected to the network. The compute node chassis is located in slot 17 of cabinet 3000, and the compute node BMCs are connected to ports 33-36 in the management leaf-bmc-bmc switch in slot 14 of cabinet 3000.

	"content": "Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe This section details how to migrate NCNs from using their onboard NICs for PXE booting to booting over the PCIe cards.\n Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe  Enabling UEFI PXE Mode  Mellanox  Print Current UEFI and SR-IOV State Setting Expected Values High-Speed Network  Obtaining Mellanox Tools     QLogic FastLinq  Kernel Modules     Disabling or Removing On-Board Connections    This applies to Newer systems (Spring 2020 or newer) where onboard NICs are still used.\nThis presents a need for migration for systems still using the legacy, preview topology. Specifically, systems with onboard connections to their leaf-bmc switches and NCNs need to disable/remove that connection.\nThis onboard NCN port came from before spine-switches were added to the shasta-network topology. The onboard connection was responsible for every network (MTL/NMN/HMN/CAN) and was the sole driver of PXE booting for. Now, NCNs use bond interfaces and spine switches for those networks; however, some older systems still have this legacy connection to their leaf-bmc switches and solely use it for PXE booting. This NIC is not used during runtime, and NCNs in this state should enable PXE within their PCIe devices' OpROMs and disable/remove this onboard connection.\nEnabling UEFI PXE Mode Mellanox The Mellanox CLI Tools are required to configure UEFI PXE from the Linux command line.\nOn any NCN (using 0.0.10 k8s, or 0.0.8 Ceph; anything built on ncn-0.0.21 or higher), run the following command to begin interacting with Mellanox cards:\n NOTE: If recovering NCNs with an earlier image without the Mellanox tools, refer to the Obtaining Mellanox Tools section.\n ncn# mst start Now mst status and other commands like mlxfwmanager or mlxconfig will work, and devices required for these commands will be created in /dev/mst.\nPrint Current UEFI and SR-IOV State  UEFI: All boots are UEFI; this needs to be enabled for access to the UEFI OpROM for configuration and for usage of UEFI firmwares. SR_IOV: This is currently DISABLED because it can attribute to longer POSTs on HPE blades (Gen10+, i.e. DL325 or DL385) with Mellanox ConnectX-5 PCIe cards. The technology is not yet enabled for virtualization usage, but may be in the future.\n Use the following snippet to display device name and current UEFI PXE state.\nncn# mst status for MST in $(ls /dev/mst/*); do mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;(Device|EXP_ROM|SRIOV_EN)\u0026#34; done Setting Expected Values Use the following snippet to enable and dump UEFI PXE state.\nfor MST in $(ls /dev/mst/*); do echo ${MST} mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_x86_ENABLE=1 mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_PXE_ENABLE=1 mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set SRIOV_EN=0 mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;EXP_ROM\u0026#34; done High-Speed Network For worker nodes with High-Speed network attachments, the PXE and SR-IOV features should be disabled.\n  Run mlxfwmanager to probe and dump the Mellanox PCIe cards.\nncn# mlxfwmanager   Find the device path for the HSN card, assuming it is a ConnectX-5 or other 100GB card, this should be easy to pick out.\n  Run the following commands, swapping the MST variable for the actual card path.\n# Set UEFI to YES ncn# MST=/dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf1 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_ARM_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_x86_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_PXE_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set SRIOV_EN=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;EXP_ROM\u0026#34;   The Mellanox HSN card is now neutralized, and will only be usable in a booted system.\nObtaining Mellanox Tools For 1.4 or later systems, mft is installed in NCN images by default.\nFor 1.3 systems, obtain the Mellanox tools with the following commands:\nlinux# wget https://www.mellanox.com/downloads/MFT/mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm.tgz linux# tar -xzvf mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm.tgz linux# cd mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm/RPMS linux# rpm -ivh ./mft-4.15.1-9.x86_64.rpm linux# cd linux# mst start QLogic FastLinq These should already be configured for PXE booting.\nKernel Modules KMP modules for Qlogic are installed:\n qlgc-fastlinq-kmp-default qlgc-qla2xxx-kmp-default  Disabling or Removing On-Board Connections The onboard connection can be disabled in a few ways; short of removing the physical connection, one may shutdown the switchport as well.\nIf the physical connection can be removed, this is preferred and can be done so after enabling PXE on the PCIe cards.\nIf the connection must be disabled, log in to the respective leaf-bmc switch.\n  Connect to the leaf-bmc switch using serial or SSH connections.\nSelect one of the connection options below. The IP addresses and device names may vary in the commands below.\n# SSH over METAL MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.1.0.4 # SSH over NODE MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.252.0.4 # SSH over HARDWARE MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.254.0.4 # or.. serial (device name will vary). pit# minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/tty.USB1   Enter configuration mode.\nsw-leaf-bmc-001\u0026gt; configure terminal sw-leaf-bmc-001(config)#\u0026gt;   Disable the NCN interfaces.\nCheck the SHCD for reference before continuing so that the interfaces connected to management NCNs are being changed. Ports 2 to 10 are commonly the master, worker, and storage nodes when there are 3 of each.

	"content": "Install CSM Abstract Installation of the CSM product stream has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order. Information about the HPE Cray EX system and the site is used to prepare the configuration payload. The initial node used to bootstrap the installation process is called the PIT node because the Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT) is installed there.\nOnce the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed with an operating system and the software to create a Kubernetes cluster utilizing Ceph storage. The CSM services provide essential software infrastructure including the API gateway and many micro-services with REST APIs for managing the system. Once administrative access has been configured, the installation of CSM software can be validated with health checks before doing operational tasks like the checking and updating of firmware on system components or the preparation of compute nodes.\nOnce the CSM installation has completed, other product streams for the HPE Cray EX system can be installed.\nTopics  Validate SHCD Prepare Configuration Payload Prepare Management Nodes Bootstrap PIT Node Configure Management Network Switches Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs Deploy Management Nodes Install CSM Services Validate CSM Health Before Final NCN Deployment Deploy Final NCN Configure Administrative Access Validate CSM Health Configure Prometheus Alert Notifications Update Firmware with FAS Prepare Compute Nodes Next Topic Troubleshooting Installation Problems  The topics in this chapter need to be done as part of an ordered procedure so are shown here with numbered topics.\nNote: If problems are encountered during the installation, some topics have their own troubleshooting sections found in the operations index. sections, but there is also a general troubleshooting topic.\nDetails \n  Validate SHCD\nThe cabling should be validated between the nodes and the management network switches. The information in the Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) can be used to confirm the cables which physically connect components of the system. Having the data in the SHCD which matches the physical cabling will be needed later in both Prepare Configuration Payload and Configure Management Network.\nSee Validate SHCD\nNote: If a reinstall or fresh install of this software release is being done on this system and the management network cabling has already been validated, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Prepare Configuration Payload \n  Prepare Configuration Payload\nInformation gathered from a site survey is needed to feed into the CSM installation process, such as system name, system size, site network information for the CAN, site DNS configuration, site NTP configuration, network information for the node used to bootstrap the installation. Much of the information about the system hardware is encapsulated in the SHCD (Shasta Cabling Diagram), which is a spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing to assemble the components of the system and connect appropriately labeled cables.\nSee Prepare Configuration Payload \n  Prepare Management Nodes\nSome preparation of the management nodes might be needed before starting an install or reinstall. The preparation includes checking and updating the firmware on the PIT node, quiescing the compute nodes and application nodes, scaling back DHCP on the management nodes, wiping the storage on the management nodes, powering off the management nodes, and possibly powering off the PIT node.\nSee Prepare Management Nodes \n  Bootstrap PIT Node The Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node needs to be bootstrapped from the LiveCD. There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node\u0026ndash;the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. The recommended media is the RemoteISO because it does not require any physical media to prepare. However, remotely mounting an ISO on a BMC does not work smoothly for nodes from all vendors. It is recommended to try the RemoteISO first.\nUse one of these procedures to bootstrap the PIT node from the LiveCD.\n Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD Remote ISO (recommended)  Gigabyte BMCs should not use the RemoteISO method. Intel BMCs should not use the RemoteISO method.   Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB (fallback)  Using the LiveCD USB method requires a USB 3.0 device with at least 1TB of space to create a bootable LiveCD. \n  Configure Management Network Switches\nNow that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD environment and CSI has generated the switch IP addresses, the management network switches can be configured.\nSee Management Network User Guide\nNote: If a reinstall of this software release is being done on this system and the management network switches have already been configured, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs \n  Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs Now that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD and the management network switches have been configured, the actual MAC addresses for the management nodes can be collected. This process will include repetition of some of the steps done up to this point because csi config init will need to be run with the proper MAC addresses.\nSee Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs\nNote: If a reinstall of this software release is being done on this system and the ncn_metadata.csv file already had valid MAC addresses for both BMC and node interfaces before csi config init was run, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Deploy Management Nodes.\nNote: If a first time install of this software release is being done on this system and the ncn_metadata.csv file already had valid MAC addresses for both BMC and node interfaces before csi config init was run, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Deploy Management Nodes. \n  Deploy Management Nodes Now that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD and the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed. This procedure will boot all of the management nodes, initialize Ceph storage on the storage nodes, and start the Kubernetes cluster on all of the worker nodes and the master nodes, except for the PIT node. The PIT node will join Kubernetes after it is rebooted later in Deploy Final NCN.\nSee Deploy Management Nodes \n  Install CSM Services Now that deployment of management nodes is complete with initialized Ceph storage and a running Kubernetes cluster on all worker and master nodes, except the PIT node, the CSM services can be installed. The Nexus repository will be populated with artifacts; containerized CSM services will be installed; and a few other configuration steps taken.\nSee Install CSM Services \n  Validate CSM Health Before Final NCN Deployment\nAfter installing all of the CSM services, now validate the health of the management nodes and all CSM services. The reason to do it now is that if there are any problems detected with the core infrastructure or the nodes, it is easy to rewind the installation to Deploy Management Nodes because the PIT node has not yet been redeployed. In addition, redeploying the PIT node successfully requires several CSM services to be working properly, so validating this is important.\nTo run the CSM health checks, see Validate CSM Health \n  Deploy Final NCN\nNow that all CSM services have been installed and the CSM health checks completed, with the possible exception of Booting the CSM Barebones Image and the UAS/UAI tests, the PIT node can be rebooted to leave the LiveCD environment and assume its intended role as one the Kubernetes master nodes.\nSee Deploy Final NCN \n  Configure Administrative Access\nNow that all of the CSM services have been installed and the PIT node has been redeployed, administrative access can be prepared. This may include configuring Keycloak with a local Keycloak account or confirming Keycloak is properly federating LDAP or other Identity Provider (IdP), initializing the \u0026lsquo;cray\u0026rsquo; CLI for administrative commands, locking the management nodes from accidental actions such as firmware updates by FAS or power actions by CAPMC, configuring the CSM layer of configuration by CFS in NCN personalization,and configuring the node BMCs (node controllers) for nodes in liquid cooled cabinets.\nSee Configure Administrative Access \n  Validate CSM Health\nNow that all management nodes have joined the Kubernetes cluster, CSM services have been installed, and administrative access has been enabled, the health of the management nodes and all CSM services should be validated. There are no exceptions to running the tests\u0026ndash;all can be run now.\nThis CSM health validation can also be run at other points during the system lifecycle, such as when replacing a management node, checking the health after a management node has rebooted because of a crash, as part of doing a full system power down or power up, or after other types of system maintenance.\nSee Validate CSM Health \n  Configure Prometheus Alert Notifications\nNow that CSM has been installed and health has been validated, if the system management health monitoring tools and specifically, Prometheus, are found to be useful, email notifications can be configured for specific alerts defined in Prometheus. Prometheus upstream documentation can be leveraged for an Alert Notification Template Reference as well as Notification Template Examples. Currently supported notification types include Slack, Pager Duty, email, or a custom integration via a generic webhook interface.\nSee Configure Prometheus Email Alert Notifications for example configuration of an email alert notification for Postgres replication alerts that are defined on the system. \n  Update Firmware with FAS\nNow that all management nodes and CSM services have been validated as healthy, the firmware on other components in the system can be checked and updated. The Firmware Action Service (FAS) communicates with many devices on the system. FAS can be used to update the firmware for all of the devices it communicates with at once, or specific devices can be targeted for a firmware update.\n IMPORTANT: Before FAS can be used to update firmware, refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg for more information about how to install the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product. The installation of HFP will inform FAS of the newest firmware available. Once FAS is aware that new firmware is available, then see Update Firmware with FAS. \n   Prepare Compute Nodes\nAfter completion of the firmware update with FAS, compute nodes can be prepared. Some compute node types have special preparation steps, but most compute nodes are ready to be used now.\nThese compute node types require preparation.\n HPE Apollo 6500 XL645d Gen10 Plus Gigabyte  See Prepare Compute Nodes \n  Next Topic\nAfter completion of the firmware update with FAS and the preparation of compute nodes, the CSM product stream has been fully installed and configured. Refer to the HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg for more information on other product streams to be installed and configured after CSM. \n  Troubleshooting Installation Problems\nThe installation of the Cray System Management (CSM) product requires knowledge of the various nodes and switches for the HPE Cray EX system. The procedures in this section should be referenced during the CSM install for additional information on system hardware, troubleshooting, and administrative tasks related to CSM.

This shared port is plugged into a port on the TOR Ethernet switch designated for the Hardware Management Network (HMN) causing the NIC to get an IP address assigned to it from the wrong pool. To prevent this from happening, the iLO VLAN tag needs to be configured for VLAN 4 and the switch port the NIC/shared iLO is plugged into needs to be configured to allow only VLAN 4 traffic. This prevents the NIC from communicating over the switch and it will no longer DHCP an IP address.\nThis procedure needs to be done for each of the HPE Apollo 6500 XL645d servers that will be managed by CSM software. River compute nodes always index their BMCs from 1. For example, the compute BMCs in servers with more than one node will have component names (xnames) as follows: x3000c0s30b1, x3000c0s30b2, x3000c0s30b3, and so on. The node indicator is always a 0. For example, x3000c0s30b1n0 or x3000c0s30b4n0.\n\n  Gather information.\nThe following is an example using x3000c0s30b1n0 as the target compute node component name (xname):\nncn# XNAME=x3000c0s30b1n0 ncn# cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --component-id \\  ${XNAME} --format json | jq \u0026#39;.[]|select((.IPAddresses|length)\u0026gt;0)\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;6805cabbc182\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MACAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;68:05:ca:bb:c1:82\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LastUpdate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-04-19T22:15:00.523621Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ComponentID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;x3000c0s30b1n0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IPAddresses\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;IPAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10.252.1.21\u0026#34; } ] } { \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9440c938f7b4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MACAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;94:40:c9:38:f7:b4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LastUpdate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-05-07T18:37:59.239924Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ComponentID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;x3000c0s30b1n0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IPAddresses\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;IPAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10.254.1.38\u0026#34; } ] } The second entry is the indication that the NIC is receiving incorrect IP addresses. The 10.254.x.y address is for the HMN and should not be associated with the node itself (x3000c0s30b1n0).\nMake a note of the ID, MACAddress, and IPAddress of the entry that has the 10.254 address listed.\nncn# ID=\u0026#34;9440c938f7b4\u0026#34; ncn# MAC=\u0026#34;94:40:c9:38:f7:b4\u0026#34; ncn# IPADDR=\u0026#34;10.254.1.38\u0026#34; These will be used later to clean up KEA and Hardware State Manager (HSM). There may not be a 10.254 address associated with the node, that is OK, it will enable skipping of several steps later on.\n\n  Configure the iLO to use VLAN 4.\n Connect to BMC WebUI and log in with standard root credentials.  From the administrators own machine create an SSH tunnel (-L creates the tunnel, and -N prevents a shell and stubs the connection): linux# BMC=x3000c0s30b1 linux# ssh -L 9443:$BMC:443 -N root@example-ncn-m001  Opening a web browser to https://localhost:9443 will give access to the BMC\u0026rsquo;s web interface. Login with the root credentials.   Click on iLO Shared Network Port on left menu. Make a note of the MAC Address under the Information section, that will be needed later. ncn# ILOMAC=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;MAC Address\u0026gt;\u0026#34; For example\nncn# ILOMAC=\u0026#34;94:40:c9:38:08:c7\u0026#34;  Click on General on the top menu. Under NIC Settings move slider to Enable VLAN. In the VLAN Tag box, enter 4. Click Apply. Click Reset iLO when it appears. Click Yes, Reset when it appears on the right. After accepting the BMC restart, connection to the BMC will be lost until the switch port reconfiguration is performed.  \n  Configure the switch port for the iLO to use VLAN 4.\n  Find the port and the switch the iLO is plugged into using the SHCD.\n  ssh to the switch and log in with standard admin credentials. Refer to /etc/hosts for exact hostname.\n  Verify the MAC on the port.\nExample using port number 46.\nsw-leaf-001# show mac-address-table | include 1/1/46 94:40:c9:38:08:c7 4 dynamic 1/1/46 Make sure the MAC address shown for that port matches the ILOMAC address noted in step 2.3 from the Information section of the WebUI\nNOTE: If the MAC is not correct, double check the server cabling and SHCD for the correct port then start this section over. Do not move on until the ILOMAC address has been found on the switch at the expected port.\n  Configure the port if the MAC is correct.\nExample using port number 46.\nsw-leaf-001# configure t sw-leaf-001(config)# int 1/1/46 sw-leaf-001(config-if)# vlan trunk allowed 4 sw-leaf-001(config-if)# write mem Copying configuration: [Success] sw-leaf-001(config-if)# exit sw-leaf-001(config)# exit   Verify the settings.\nsw-leaf-001# show running-config interface 1/1/46 interface 1/1/46 no shutdown mtu 9198 description dl645d no routing vlan trunk native 1 vlan trunk allowed 4 spanning-tree bpdu-guard spanning-tree port-type admin-edge exit After a few minutes the switch will be configured and access to the WebUI will be regained.\n  \n  Clear bad MAC and IP address out of KEA.\nNOTE: Skip this step if there was no bad MAC and IPADDR found in step 1.\nRetrieve a bearer token if you have not done so already.\nncn# export TOKEN=$(curl -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \\  -d client_id=admin-client \\  -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.client-secret}\u0026#39; | base64 -d` \\  https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r \u0026#39;.access_token\u0026#39;) Remove the entry from KEA that is associated with the MAC and IPADDRESS gathered in section 1.1.\nncn# curl -s -k -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\u0026#34; -X POST -H \\ \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lease4-del\u0026#34;, \\ \u0026#34;service\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;dhcp4\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;arguments\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;hw-address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#39;${MAC}\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, \\ \u0026#34;ip-address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#39;${IPADDR}\u0026#39;\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/dhcp-kea Expected results:\n[ { \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;IPv4 lease deleted.\u0026#34; } ] \n  Clear bad ID out of HSM.\nNOTE: Skip this step if there was no bad ID found in step 1.\nTell HSM to delete the bad ID out of the Ethernet Interfaces table.\nncn# cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete $ID Expected results:\n{ \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;deleted 1 entry\u0026#34; }   Everything is now configured and the CSM software will automatically discover the node after several minutes. After it has been discovered, the node is ready to be booted.\n1. Update the BIOS Time on Gigabyte Compute Nodes The BIOS time for Gigabyte compute nodes must be synced with the rest of the system.

	"content": "Prepare Configuration Payload The configuration payload consists of the information which must be known about the HPE Cray EX system so it can be passed to the csi (Cray Site Init) program during the CSM installation process.\nInformation gathered from a site survey is needed to feed into the CSM installation process, such as system name, system size, site network information for the CAN, site DNS configuration, site NTP configuration, network information for the node used to bootstrap the installation. More detailed component level information about the system hardware is encapsulated in the SHCD (Shasta Cabling Diagram), which is a spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing to assemble the components of the system and connect appropriately labeled cables.\nHow the configuration payload is prepared depends on whether this is a first time installation of CSM software on this system or the CSM software is being reinstalled. The reinstall scenario has the advantage of being able to use the configuration payload from the previous CSM installation and an additional configuration file which that installation generated. The first time install scenario requires using the csi config tool to pass arguments to CSI as well as the creation of a number of Configuration Payload Files.\nTopics  Command Line Configuration Payload Configuration Payload Files First Time Install Reinstall Next Topic  Command Line Configuration Payload The information from a site survey can be given to the csi command as command line arguments. The information and options shown below are to explain what data is needed. It will not be used until moving to the Bootstrap PIT Node procedure.\nThe air-cooled cabinet is known to csi as a river cabinet. The liquid-cooled cabinets are either mountain or hill (if a TDS system).\nFor more description of these settings and the default values, see Default IP Address Ranges and the other topics in CSM Overview.

It can be helpful to create a Bash script file to call the csi command with all of these options, and then edit that file to adjust the values for the particular system being installed. The bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user and bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass must match what is used for the BMC account and its password for the management nodes. Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on this node connected to the site. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes   The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help output for more information. An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters. Several parameters (can-gateway, can-cidr, can-static-pool, can-dynamic-pool) describe the CAN (Customer Access network). The can-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CAN. The can-cidr is the IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system. The can-static-pool and can-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. Several parameters (cmn-gateway, cmn-cidr, cmn-static-pool, cmn-dynamic-pool) describe the CMN (Customer Management network). The cmn-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CMN. The cmn-cidr is the IP subnet for the CMN assigned to this system. The cmn-static-pool and cmn-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. The cmn-external-dns is the static IP address assigned to the DNS instance running in the cluster to which requests the cluster subdomain will be forwarded. The cmn-external-dns IP address must be within the cnn-static-pool range. Set ntp-pool to a reachable NTP server. The application_node_config.yaml file is required. It is used to describe the mapping between prefixes in hmn_connections.csv and HSM subroles. This file also defines aliases application nodes. For details, see Create Application Node YAML. For systems that use non-sequential cabinet id numbers, use cabinets-yaml to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file can include information about the starting ID for each cabinet type and number of cabinets which have separate command line options, but is a way to specify explicitly the id of every cabinet in the system. See Create Cabinets YAML. The PowerDNS zone transfer arguments primary-server-name, secondary-servers, and notify-zones are optional unless zone transfer is being configured. For more information see the PowerDNS Configuration Guide  Configuration Payload Files A few configuration files are needed for the installation of CSM. These are all provided to the csi command during the installation process.\n   Filename Source Information     cabinets.yaml SHCD The number and type of air-cooled and liquid-cooled cabinets. cabinet IDs, and VLAN numbers   application_node_config.yaml SHCD The number and type of application nodes with mapping from the name in the SHCD to the desired hostname   hmn_connections.json SHCD The network topology for HMN of the entire system   ncn_metadata.csv SHCD, other The number of master, worker, and storage nodes and MAC address information for BMC and bootable NICs   switch_metadata.csv SHCD Inventory of all spine, leaf, CDU, and leaf-bmc switches    Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json. The ncn_metadata.csv does require collection of MAC addresses from the management nodes because that information is not present in the SHCD.\ncabinets.yaml The cabinets.yaml file describes the type of cabinets in the system, the number of each type of cabinet, and the starting cabinet ID for every cabinet in the system. This file can be used to indicate that a system has non-contiguous cabinet ID numbers or non-standard VLAN numbers.\nThe component names (xnames) used in the other files should fit within the cabinet ids defined by the starting cabinet id for River cabinets (modified by the number of cabinets). It is OK for management nodes not to be in x3000 (as the first River cabinet), but they must be in one of the River cabinets. For example, x3000 with 2 cabinets would mean x3000 or x3001 should have all management nodes.\nSee Create Cabinets YAML for instructions about creating this file.\napplication_node_config.yaml The application_node_config.yaml file controls how the csi config init command finds and treats application nodes discovered in the hmn_connections.json file when building the SLS Input file.\nDifferent node prefixes in the SHCD can be identified as Application nodes. Each node prefix can be mapped to a specific HSM sub role. These sub roles can then be used as the targets of Ansible plays run by CFS to configure these nodes. The component name (xname) for each Application node can be assigned one or more hostname aliases.\nSee Create Application Node YAML for instructions about creating this file.\nhmn_connections.json The hmn_connections.json file is extracted from the HMN tab of the SHCD spreadsheet. The CSM release includes the hms-shcd-parser container which can be used on the PIT node booted from the LiveCD (RemoteISO or USB device) or a Linux system to do this extraction. Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json.\nNo action is required to create this file at this point, and it will be created when the PIT node is bootstrapped.\nncn_metadata.csv The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.\nFor each management node, the component name (xname), role, and subrole can be extracted from the SHCD. However, the rest of the MAC address information needs to be collected another way. Collect as much information as possible before the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD and then get the rest later when directed. See the scenarios which enable partial data collection below in First Time Install.\nSee Create NCN Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\nswitch_metadata.csv The switch_metadata.csv file is manually created to include information about all spine, leaf, CDU, and leaf-bmc switches in the system. None of the Slingshot switches for the HSN should be included in this file.\nSee Create Switch Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\nFirst Time Install The process to install for the first time must collect the information needed to create these files.\n  Collect data for cabinets.yaml.\nSee Create Cabinets YAML for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for application_node_config.yaml.\nSee Create Application Node YAML for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for ncn_metadata.csv.\nSee Create NCN Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for switch_metadata.csv.\nSee Create Switch Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\n  Reinstall The process to reinstall must have the configuration payload files available.\n  Collect Payload for Reinstall.\n  These files from a previous install are needed to do a reinstall.\n application_node_config.yaml (if used previously) cabinets.yaml (if used previously) hmn_connections.json ncn_metadata.csv switch_metadata.csv system_config.yaml  If the system_config.yaml is not available, then a reinstall cannot be done. Switch to the install process and generate any of the other files for the Configuration Payload Files which are missing.\n  The command line options used to call csi config init are not needed.\nWhen doing a reinstall, all of the command line options which had been given to csi config init during the previous installation will be found inside the system_config.yaml file. This simplifies the reinstall process.\nWhen you are ready to bootstrap the LiveCD, it will indicate when to run this command without any extra command line options. It will expect to find all of the above files in the current working directory.\n NOTE: For fresh installs and reinstalls of CSM 1.2 or later, it is recommended that the install-ncn-bond-members option be double-checked. Systems with Mellanox PCIe cards will have new interface names.\n  Compare the output of lid with the background document here for PCIe devices. Cross-reference the Vendor ID with the IDs in the table in Vendor and Bus ID Identification.\n\u0026lt;lan\u0026gt; \u0026lt;vid\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;did\u0026gt; pit# lid p238p1 8086:1521 p238p2 8086:1521 p238p3 15B3:1013 p238p4 15B3:1013    Update system_config.yaml\u0026rsquo;s install-ncn-bond-members value with the interface names cross-referenced from the lid output.

Both of those can use this procedure. The only difference in this procedure is that the RemoteISO method will execute these commands on the PIT node, while the USB method could be done on any Linux system. This procedure works for both methods, so in order to be generic, this document uses the command prompt of linux# in its examples.\n Background Create and Initialize Site-Init Directory Create Baseline System Customizations Generate Sealed Secrets Version Control Site-Init Files  Push to a Remote Repository   Customer-Specific Customizations  Prerequisites The procedures on this page assumes that the SYSTEM_NAME, CSM_RELEASE, CSM_PATH, and PITDATA variables are set and exported.

Unfortunately, older versions of OpenSSL may not support -nameopt on the s_client command or may use a different default format. As a result, your mileage may vary; however, you should be able to extract the issuer certificate manually from the output of the above openssl s_client example if the following commands are unsuccessful.\n   Observe the issuer\u0026rsquo;s DN.\nlinux# openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect ${LDAP}:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | grep issuer= | sed -e \u0026#39;s/^issuer=//\u0026#39; Expected output includes a line similar to this:\nemailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US   Extract the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate using awk.\n NOTE The issuer DN is properly escaped as part of the awk pattern below.

Add a remote repository and push the baseline configuration on master branch to a corresponding remote branch.\n6. Customer-Specific Customizations Customer-specific customizations are any changes on top of the baseline configuration to satisfy customer-specific requirements. It is recommended that customer-specific customizations be tracked on branches separate from the mainline in order to make them easier to manage.\nApply any customer-specific customizations by merging the corresponding branches into master branch of site-init.\nWhen considering merges, and especially when resolving conflicts, carefully examine differences to ensure all changes are relevant. For example, when applying a customer-specific customization used in a prior version, be sure the change still makes sense. It is common for options to change as new features are introduced and bugs are fixed.\n"

	"content": "Create Application Node Config YAML This topic provides directions on constructing the application_node_config.yaml file. This file controls how the csi config init command finds and treats application nodes discovered in the hmn_connections.json file when generating configuration files for the system.\n Prerequisites Background Directions  Prerequisites The application_node_config.yaml file can be constructed from information from one of the following sources:\n The SHCD Excel spreadsheet for the system The hmn_connections.json file generated from the system\u0026rsquo;s SHCD  Background SHCD and hmn_connections.json The HMN tab of the SHCD describes the air-cooled hardware present in the system and how these devices are connected to the Hardware Management Network (HMN). This information is required by CSM to perform hardware discovery and geolocation of air-cooled hardware in the system. The HMN tab may contain other hardware that is not managed by CSM, but is connected to the HMN.\nThe hmn_connections.json file is derived from the HMN tab of a system SHCD, and is one of the seed files required by Cray Site Init (CSI) command to generate configuration files required to install CSM. The hmn_connections.json file is almost a one-to-one copy of the right-hand table in the HMN tab of the SHCD. It is an array of JSON objects, and each object represents a row from the HMN tab. Any row that is not understood by CSI will be ignored, this includes any additional devices connected to the HMN that are not managed by CSM.\nFor a detailed mapping between the data in the SHCD and the equivalent information in the hmn_connections.json file, see Introduction to SHCD HMN Connections Rules.\nWhat is a Source Name? The source name is the name of the device that is being connected to the HMN network. In the SHCD HMN tab, this is in a column with the header Source or the Source field in the element of the hmn_connections.json for this device. From this source name, the csi config init command can infer the type of hardware that is connected to the HMN network (Node BMC, PDU, HSN Switch, BMC, and more).\nExample SHCD row from HMN tab with column headers representing an application node with SourceName uan01 in cabinet x3000 in slot 19.

In general, everything in the HMN tab of the SHCD or hmn_connections.json file that starts with uan, gn, or ln, are considered application nodes and any node that does not follow the SHCD/HMN Connections Rules should also be considered an application node, unless it is a KVM.\nIf the hmn_connections.json file is not available, then use the HMN tab of SHCD spreadsheet. This table is equivalent to the example hmn_connections.json output below.\n   Source (J20) Rack (K20) Location (L20) (M20) Parent (N20) (O20) Port (P20) Destination (Q20) Rack (R20) Location (S20) (T20) Port (U20)     gateway01 x3000 u29   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j42   login02 x3000 u28   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j43   lnet01 x3000 u27   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j41   vn01 x3000 u25   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j40   uan01 x3000 u23   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j39    If the hmn_connections.json file is available, then the following command can be used to show the HMN rows that are application nodes.\nlinux# cat hmn_connections.json | jq -rc \u0026#39;.[] | select(.Source | test(\u0026#34;^((mn|wn|sn|nid|cn|cn\\\\-|pdu)\\\\d+|.*(cmc|rcm|kvm|door).*|x\\\\d+p\\\\d*|sw-.+|columbia$)\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;) | not)\u0026#39;  Example hmn_connections.json output:\n{\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u29\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j42\u0026#34;}, {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u28\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j43\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u27\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j41\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;vn01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u25\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j40\u0026#34;}, {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u23\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j39\u0026#34;},   Add additional application node prefixes.\nThe prefixes field is an array of strings, that augments the list of source name prefixes that are treated as application nodes. By default, csi config init only looks for application nodes that have source names that start with uan, gn, and ln. If the system contains application nodes that fall outside of those source name prefixes, then additional prefixes must be added to application_node_config.yaml. These additional prefixes will be used in addition to the default prefixes.\nTo add an additional prefix, append a new string element to the prefixes array.\n NOTE: The command csi config init does a case insensitive check for whether a source name contains an application node prefix. For example, the prefix uan will match uan, Uan, and UAN.\n From the HMN example above, the following additional prefixes are required:\n# Additional application node prefixes to match in the hmn_connections.json file prefixes: - gateway - login - lnet - vn   Add HSM SubRoles for application node prefixes.\nThe prefix_hsm_subroles field mapping application node prefix (string) to the applicable Hardware State Manager (HSM) SubRole (string) for the application nodes. All applications nodes have the HSM Role of Application, and the SubRole value can be used to label what type of the application node it is (such as UAN, Gateway, LNETRouter, and more).\nBy default, the csi config init command will use the following SubRoles for application nodes:\n   Prefix HSM SubRole     uan UAN   ln UAN   gn Gateway    If there are no additional prefixes in the SHCD or no desire to use a different HSM SubRole than the default, then this prefix_hsm_subroles field does not need any data populated.\nTo add additional HSM SubRole for a given prefix, add a new mapping under the prefix_hsm_subroles field. Where the key is the application node prefix and the value is the HSM SubRole.\nValid HSM SubRoles values are: Worker, Master, Storage, UAN, Gateway, LNETRouter, Visualization, and UserDefined.\nFrom the HMN example above, the following additional prefix HSM SubRole mappings are required:\n# Additional HSM SubRoles prefix_hsm_subroles: login: UAN lnet: LNETRouter gateway: Gateway vn: Visualization   Add application node aliases.\nThe aliases field is a map of component name (xname) strings to an array of alias strings.\n For guidance on building application node component names (xnames), follow one of the following:\n Building component names (xnames) for nodes in a single application node chassis Building component names (xnames) for nodes in a dual application node chassis   By default, the csi config init command does not set the ExtraProperties.Alias field for application nodes in the SLS input file.\nFor each application node, add its alias mapping under the aliases field. Where the key is the component name (xname) of the application node, and the value is an array of aliases (strings) which allows for one or more aliases to be specified for an application node.\nFrom the HMN example above, the following application node aliases are required:\n# Application Node aliases aliases: x3113c0s29b0n0: [\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s28b0n0: [\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s27b0n0: [\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s25b0n0: [\u0026#34;visualization01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vn02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s23b0n0: [\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;]  The ordering of component names (xnames) under aliases does not matter.\n   Final information in the example application_node_config.yaml built from the HMN example above.\n--- # Additional application node prefixes to match in the hmn_connections.json file prefixes: - gateway - login - lnet - vn # Additional HSM SubRoles prefix_hsm_subroles: login: UAN lnet: LNETRouter gateway: Gateway vn: Visualization # Application Node aliases aliases: x3113c0s29b0n0: [\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s28b0n0: [\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s27b0n0: [\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s25b0n0: [\u0026#34;visualization01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vn02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s23b0n0: [\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;]   "

	"content": "Create NCN Metadata CSV The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.\nSome of the data in the ncn_metadata.csv can be found in the SHCD in the HMN tab. However, the hardest data to collect is the MAC addresses for the node\u0026rsquo;s BMC, the node\u0026rsquo;s bootable network interface, and the pair of network interfaces which will become the bonded interface bond0.\nTopics  Introduction  LACP Bonding   PXE or BOOTSTRAP MAC Sample ncn_metadata.csv Collection of MAC Addresses  Details Introduction Each of the management nodes is represented as a row in the ncn_metadata.csv file.\nFor example:\nXname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92 For each management node, the component name (xname), role, and subrole can be extracted from the SHCD in the HMN tab. However, the rest of the MAC address information needs to be collected another way.\nCheck the description for component names while mapping names between the SHCD and the ncn_metadata.csv file. See Component Names (xnames).\nThere are two interesting parts to the NCN metadata file:\n The MAC of the BMC The MAC(s) of the shasta-network interface(s)  The \u0026ldquo;shasta-network interface\u0026rdquo; is the interfaces, one or more, that comprise the NCNs' LACP link-aggregation ports.\nLACP Bonding NCNs may have one or more bond interfaces, which may be comprised from one or more physical interfaces. The preferred default configuration is two physical network interfaces per bond. The number of bonds themselves depends on the systems network topology.\nFor example, systems with 4 network interfaces on a given node could configure either of these permutations (for redundancy minimums within Shasta cluster):\n One bond with 4 interfaces (bond0) Two bonds with 2 interfaces each (bond0 and bond1)  For more information, see NCN Networking page for NCNs.\nPXE or BOOTSTRAP MAC In general this refers to the interface to be used when the node attempts to PXE boot. This varies between vintages of systems; systems before \u0026ldquo;Spring 2020\u0026rdquo; often booted NCNs with onboard NICs, newer systems boot over their PCIe cards.\nIf the system is booting over PCIe then the \u0026ldquo;bootstrap MAC\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;bond0 MAC0\u0026rdquo; will be identical. If the system is booting over onboard NICs then the \u0026ldquo;bootstrap MAC\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;bond0 MAC0\u0026rdquo; will be different.\n Other Nomenclature\n  \u0026ldquo;BOND MACS\u0026rdquo; are the MAC addresses for the physical interfaces that the node will use for the various VLANs. BOND0 MAC0 and BOND0 MAC1 should not be on the same physical network card to establish redundancy for failed chips. On the other hand, if any nodes' capacity prevents it from being redundant, then MAC1 and MAC0 will still produce a valid configuration if they do reside on the same physical chip/card. The BMC MAC is the exclusive, dedicated LAN for the onboard BMC. It should not be swapped with any other device.  Sample ncn_metadata.csv The following are sample rows from a ncn_metadata.csv file:\n  Use case: NCN with a single PCIe card (1 card with 2 ports):\n Notice how the MAC address for Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 are only off by 1, which indicates that they are on the same 2 port card.\n Xname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s6b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:77:b8,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:01   Use case: NCN with a dual PCIe cards (2 cards with 2 ports each for 4 ports total):\n   Notice how the MAC address for Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 have a difference greater than 1, which indicates that they are on not on the same 2 port same card.\n Xname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92   Example ncn_metadata.csv file for a system that has been configured as follows:\n Management NCNs are configured to boot over the PCIe NICs Master and Storage management NCNs have two 2 port PCIe cards Worker management NCNs have one 2 port PCIe card   Because the NCNs have been configured to boot over their PCIe NICs, the Bootstrap MAC and Bond0 MAC0 columns have the same value.\n IMPORTANT: Mind the index for each group of nodes (3, 2, 1\u0026hellip;. ; not 1, 2, 3). If storage nodes are ncn-s001 x3000c0s7b0n0, ncn-s002 x3000c0s8b0n0, ncn-s003 x3000c0s9b0n0, then their portion of the file would be ordered x3000c0s9b0n0, x3000c0s8b0n0, x3000c0s7b0n0.\nXname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92 x3000c0s8b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:87:5a,14:02:ec:d9:7b:c8,14:02:ec:d9:7b:c8,94:40:c9:5f:b6:5c x3000c0s7b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:0a:2a,14:02:ec:d9:7c:88,14:02:ec:d9:7c:88,94:40:c9:5f:9a:a8 x3000c0s6b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:77:b8,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:01 x3000c0s5b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:35:03:06,14:02:ec:d9:76:b8,14:02:ec:d9:76:b8,14:02:ec:d9:76:b9 x3000c0s4b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:67:60,14:02:ec:d9:7c:40,14:02:ec:d9:7c:40,14:02:ec:d9:7c:41 x3000c0s3b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:04:84,14:02:ec:d9:79:e8,14:02:ec:d9:79:e8,94:40:c9:5f:b5:cc x3000c0s2b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:f9:b4,14:02:ec:da:b8:18,14:02:ec:da:b8:18,94:40:c9:5f:a3:a8 x3000c0s1b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:87:32,14:02:ec:da:b9:98,14:02:ec:da:b9:98,14:02:ec:da:b9:99 Collection of MAC Addresses Collect as much information as possible for the ncn_metadata.csv file before the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD and then get the rest later when directed. Having dummy MAC addresses, such as de:ad:be:ef:00:00, in the ncn_metadata.csv file is acceptable until the point during the install at which the management network switches have been configured and the PIT node can be used to collect the information. The correct MAC addresses are needed before attempting to boot the management nodes with their real image in Deploy Management Nodes\n  If the nodes are booted to Linux, then the data can be collected by ipmitool lan print for the BMC MAC, and the ip address command for the other NICs. This is rarely the case for a first time install. The PIT node examples of using these two commands could be extrapolated for other nodes which are booted to Linux. See the PIT node examples in Collecting BMC MAC Addresses and Collecting NCN MAC Addresses.\n  If the nodes are powered up and there is SSH access to the spine and leaf-bmc switches, it is possible to collect information from the spine and leaf-bmc switches.\n The BMC MAC address can be collected from the switches using knowledge about the cabling of the HMN from the SHCD. See Collecting BMC MAC Addresses. The node MAC addresses cannot be collected until after the PIT node has booted from the LiveCD. At that point, a partial boot of the management nodes can be done to collect the remaining information from the conman console logs on the PIT node using the Procedure: iPXE Consoles    If the nodes are powered up and there is no SSH access to the spine and leaf switches, it is possible to connect to the spine and leaf switches using the method described in Connect to Switch over USB-Serial Cable.\n The BMC MAC address can be collected from the switches using knowledge about the cabling of the HMN from the SHCD. See Collecting BMC MAC Addresses. The node MAC addresses cannot be collected until after the PIT node has booted from the LiveCD. At that point, a partial boot of the management nodes can be done to collect the remaining information from the conman console logs on the PIT node using the Procedure: iPXE Consoles    In all other cases, the full information needed for ncn_metadata.csv will not be available for collection until after the PIT node has been booted from the LiveCD. Having incorrect MAC addresses in the ncn_metadata.csv file as placeholders is acceptable until the point during the install at which the management network switches have been configured and the PIT node can be used to collect the information.\n At that point in the installation workflow, the Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs procedure will be used.    Unless the system does not use or does not have onboard NICs on the management nodes, then this topic may be necessary before constructing the ncn_metadata.csv file.\n See Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe for more information.

	"content": "Deploy Management Nodes The following procedure deploys Linux and Kubernetes software to the management NCNs. Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes followed by the master nodes and worker nodes together. After the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process completes for all nodes, the Ceph storage is initialized and the Kubernetes cluster is created and ready for a workload. The PIT node will join Kubernetes after it is rebooted later in Deploy Final NCN.\nTiming of Deployments The timing of each set of boots varies based on hardware. Nodes from some manufacturers will POST faster than others or vary based on BIOS setting. After powering on a set of nodes, an administrator can expect a healthy boot session to take about 60 minutes depending on the number of storage and worker nodes.\nTopics  Prepare for Management Node Deployment  Tokens and IPMI Password Ensure Time Is Accurate Before Deploying NCNs   Update Management Node Firmware Deploy Management Nodes  Deploy Workflow Deploy Check LVM on Masters and Workers Check for Unused Drives on Utility Storage Nodes   Configure after Management Node Deployment  LiveCD Cluster Authentication Install Tests and Test Server on NCNs Remove the default NTP pool   Validate Management Node Deployment  Validation Optional Validation   Next Topic  1. Prepare for Management Node Deployment Preparation of the environment must be done before attempting to deploy the management nodes.\n1.1 Tokens and IPMI Password   Define shell environment variables that will simplify later commands to deploy management nodes.\nNotice that one of them is the IPMI_PASSWORD. Replace changeme with the real root password for BMCs.\npit# export mtoken=\u0026#39;ncn-m(?!001)\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; pit# export stoken=\u0026#39;ncn-s\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; pit# export wtoken=\u0026#39;ncn-w\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; pit# export USERNAME=root pit# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme Throughout the guide, simple one-liners can be used to query status of expected nodes. If the shell or environment is terminated, these environment variables should be re-exported.\nExamples:\nCheck power status of all NCNs.\npit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power status Power off all NCNs.\npit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power off   1.2 Ensure Time Is Accurate Before Deploying NCNs NOTE: If you wish to use a timezone other than UTC, instead of step 1 below, follow this procedure for setting a local timezone, then proceed to step 2.\n  Ensure that the PIT node has the current and correct time.\nThe time can be inaccurate if the system has been powered off for a long time, or, for example, the CMOS was cleared on a Gigabyte node. See Clear Gigabyte CMOS.\n This step should not be skipped\n Check the time on the PIT node to see whether it matches the current time:\npit# date \u0026#34;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N%z\u0026#34; If the time is inaccurate, set the time manually.\npit# timedatectl set-time \u0026#34;2019-11-15 00:00:00\u0026#34; Run the NTP script:\npit# /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh This ensures that the PIT is configured with an accurate date/time, which will be properly propagated to the NCNs during boot.\nIf you receive the error Failed to set time: NTP unit is active you will need to stop chrony first.\npit# systemctl stop chronyd Then run the commands above to complete the process.\n  Ensure the current time is set in BIOS for all management NCNs.\n If each NCN is booted to the BIOS menu, you can check and set the current UTC time.\n pit# export USERNAME=root pit# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme Repeat the following process for each NCN.\n  Start an IPMI console session to the NCN.\npit# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt # Change this to be each node in turn. pit# conman -j $bmc   Using another terminal to watch the console, boot the node to BIOS.\npit# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt # Change this to be each node in turn. pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis bootdev bios pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power off pit# sleep 10 pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power on  For HPE NCNs the above process will boot the nodes to their BIOS, but the menu is unavailable through conman as the node is booted into a graphical BIOS menu.\nTo access the serial version of the BIOS setup. Perform the ipmitool steps above to boot the node. Then in conman press ESC+9 key combination when you see the following messages in the console. This will open a menu you use to enter the BIOS via conman.\nFor access via BIOS Serial Console: Press \u0026#39;ESC+9\u0026#39; for System Utilities Press \u0026#39;ESC+0\u0026#39; for Intelligent Provisioning Press \u0026#39;ESC+!\u0026#39; for One-Time Boot Menu Press \u0026#39;ESC+@\u0026#39; for Network Boot For HPE NCNs the date configuration menu can be found at the following path: System Configuration -\u0026gt; BIOS/Platform Configuration (RBSU) -\u0026gt; Date and Time\nAlternatively, for HPE NCNs you can log in to the BMC\u0026rsquo;s web interface and access the HTML5 console for the node, in order to interact with the graphical BIOS. From the administrator\u0026rsquo;s own machine, create an SSH tunnel (-L creates the tunnel; -N prevents a shell and stubs the connection):\nlinux# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt # Change this to be each node in turn. linux# ssh -L 9443:$bmc:443 -N root@eniac-ncn-m001 Opening a web browser to https://localhost:9443 will give access to the BMC\u0026rsquo;s web interface.\n   When the node boots, you will be able to use the conman session to see the BIOS menu to check and set the time to current UTC time. The process varies depending on the vendor of the NCN.\n  After you have verified the correct time, power off the NCN.\n  Repeat the above process for each NCN.\n  2. Update Management Node Firmware  All firmware can be found in the HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\n The management nodes are expected to have certain minimum firmware installed for BMC, node BIOS, and PCIe card firmware. Where possible, the firmware should be updated prior to install. It is good to meet the minimum NCN firmware requirement before starting.\n Note: When the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD, it is not possible to use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) to update the the firmware because that service has not yet been installed. However, at this point, it would be possible to use the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product on the PIT node to learn about the firmware versions available in HFP.\n If the firmware is not updated at this point in the installation workflow, then it can be done with FAS after CSM and HFP have both been installed and configured. However, at that point a rolling reboot procedure for the management nodes will be needed, after the firmware has been updated.\nSee the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center for information about the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product.\nIn the HFP documentation there is information about the recommended firmware packages to be installed. See \u0026ldquo;Product Details\u0026rdquo; in the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide.\nSome of the component types have manual procedures to check firmware versions and update firmware. See \u0026ldquo;Upgrading Firmware Without FAS\u0026rdquo; in the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide. It will be possible to extract the files from the product tarball, but the install.sh script from that product will be unable to load the firmware versions into the Firmware Action Services (FAS) because the management nodes are not booted and running Kubernetes and FAS cannot be used until Kubernetes is running.\nIf booted into the PIT node, the firmware can be found with HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\n  (optional) Check these BIOS settings on management nodes NCN BIOS.\n This is optional, the BIOS settings (or lack thereof) do not prevent deployment. The NCN Installation will work with the CMOS' default BIOS. There may be settings that facilitate the speed of deployment, but they may be tuned at a later time.\n  NOTE The BIOS tuning will be automated, further reducing this step.\n   The firmware on the management nodes should be checked for compliance with the minimum required version and updated, if necessary, at this point.\n WARNING: Gigabyte NCNs running BIOS version C20 can become unusable when Shasta 1.5 is installed. This is a result of a bug in the Gigabyte firmware. This bug has not been observed in BIOS version C17.\nA key symptom of this bug is that the NCN will not PXE boot and will instead fall through to the boot menu, despite being configure to PXE boot. This behavior will persist until the failing node\u0026rsquo;s CMOS is cleared.\n  See Clear Gigabyte CMOS.    3. Deploy Management Nodes Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes first. Then, the master nodes and worker nodes should be booted together. After the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process is complete for all nodes, the Ceph storage will have been initialized and the Kubernetes cluster will be created ready for a workload.\n3.1 Deploy Workflow The configuration workflow described here is intended to help understand the expected path for booting and configuring. The actual steps you will be performing are in the Deploy section.\n Start watching the consoles for ncn-s001 and at least one other storage node Boot all storage nodes at the same time  The first storage node ncn-s001 will boot and then starts a loop as ceph-ansible configuration waits for all other storage nodes to boot The other storage nodes boot and become passive. They will be fully configured when ceph-ansible runs to completion on ncn-s001   Once ncn-s001 notices that all other storage nodes have booted, ceph-ansible will begin Ceph configuration. This takes several minutes. Once ceph-ansible has finished on ncn-s001, then ncn-s001 waits for ncn-m002 to create /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf. Start watching the consoles for ncn-m002, ncn-m003, and at least one worker node Boot master nodes (ncn-m002 and ncn-m003) and all worker nodes at the same time  The worker nodes will boot and wait for ncn-m002 to create the /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane so they can join Kubernetes The third master node ncn-m003 boots and waits for ncn-m002 to create the /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane so it can join Kubernetes The second master node ncn-m002 boots, runs the kubernetes-cloudinit.sh which will create /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf and /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane, then waits for the storage node to create etcd-backup-s3-credentials   Once ncn-s001 notices that ncn-m002 has created /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf, then ncn-s001 waits for any worker node to become available. Once each worker node notices that ncn-m002 has created /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane, then it will join the Kubernetes cluster.  Now ncn-s001 should notice this from any one of the worker nodes and move forward with creation of ConfigMaps and running the post-Ceph playbooks (s3, OSD pools, quotas, etc.)   Once ncn-s001 creates etcd-backup-s3-credentials during the ceph-rgw-users role which is one of the last roles after Ceph has been set up, then ncn-m001 notices this and moves forward  NOTE: If several hours have elapsed between storage and master nodes booting, or if there were issues PXE booting master nodes, the cloud init script on ncn-s001 may not complete successfully. This can cause the /var/log/cloud-init-output.log on master node(s) to continue to output the following message:\n[ 1328.351558] cloud-init[8472]: Waiting for storage node to create etcd-backup-s3-credentials secret\u0026hellip;\nIn this case, the following script is safe to be executed again on ncn-s001:\nncn-s001# /srv/cray/scripts/common/storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh\nAfter this script finishes, the secrets will be created and the cloud-init script on the master node(s) should complete.\n   3.2 Deploy   Set the default root password and SSH keys and optionally change the timezone.\nThe management nodes images do not contain a default password or default ssh keys.\nIt is required to set the default root password and SSH keys in the images used to boot the management nodes. Follow the NCN image customization steps in Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node\n  Create boot directories for any NCN in DNS This will create folders for each host in /var/www, allowing each host to have their own unique set of artifacts; kernel, initrd, SquashFS, and script.ipxe bootscript.\n NOTE This script depends on IPMI_PASSWORD being set, this is done in Tokens and IPMI Password\n pit# /root/bin/set-sqfs-links.sh   Customize boot scripts for any out-of-baseline NCNs\n kubernetes-worker nodes with more than 2 small disks need to make adjustments to prevent bare-metal etcd creation A brief overview of what is expected is here, in disk plan of record / baseline    Run the BIOS Baseline script to apply a configs to BMCs. The script will apply helper configs to facilitate more deterministic network booting on any NCN port.

If any of the lsblk commands return no output, then the check is a failure. Any failures must be resolved before continuing. See the following section for details on how to do so.\n3.3.4 LVM Check Failure Recovery If there are LVM check failures, then the problem must be resolved before continuing with the install.\n  If any master node has the problem, then you must wipe and redeploy all of the NCNs before continuing the installation:\n Wipe each worker node using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Wipe each master node (except ncn-m001 because it is the PIT node) using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Wipe each storage node using the \u0026lsquo;Full Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Return to the Set each node to always UEFI Network Boot, and ensure they are powered off step of the Deploy Management Nodes section above.    If only worker nodes have the problem, then you must wipe and redeploy the affected worker nodes before continuing the installation:\n Wipe each affected worker node using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Power off each affected worker node. Return to the Boot the Master and Worker Nodes step of the Deploy Management Nodes section above.  Note: The ipmitool command will give errors trying to power on the unaffected nodes, because they are already powered on \u0026ndash; this is expected and not a problem.      3.4 Check for Unused Drives on Utility Storage Nodes  IMPORTANT: Do the following if NCNs are Gigabyte hardware. It is suggested (but optional) for HPE NCNs.\nIMPORTANT: Estimate the expected number of OSDs using the following table and using this equation:\ntotal_osds = (num of utility storage/ceph nodes) * (OSD count from table below for the appropriate hardware)\n    Hardware Manufacturer OSD Drive Count (not including OS drives)     GigaByte 12   HPE 8    Option 1 If you have OSDs on each node (ceph osd tree can show this), then you have all your nodes in Ceph. That means you can utilize the orchestrator to look for the devices.\n  Get the number of OSDs in the cluster.\nncn-s# ceph -f json-pretty osd stat |jq .num_osds 24 IMPORTANT: If the returned number of OSDs is equal to total_osds calculated, then you can skip the following steps. If not, then please proceed with the below additional checks and remediation steps.\n  Compare your number of OSDs to your output which should resemble the example below. The number of drives will depend on the server hardware.\n NOTE: If your Ceph cluster is large and has a lot of nodes, you can specify a node after the below command to limit the results.\n ncn-s# ceph orch device ls Hostname Path Type Serial Size Health Ident Fault Available ncn-s001 /dev/sda ssd PHYF015500M71P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF016500TZ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF016402EB1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF016504831P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sde ssd PHYF016500TV1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016501131P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF016500YB1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF016500WN1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sda ssd PHYF0155006W1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF0155006Z1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF015500L61P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF015502631P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sde ssd PHYF0153000G1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016401T41P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF016504C21P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF015500GQ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sda ssd PHYF016402FP1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF016401TE1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF015500N51P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF0165010Z1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sde ssd PHYF016500YR1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016500X01P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF0165011H1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF016500TQ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No If you have devices that are \u0026ldquo;Available = Yes\u0026rdquo; and they are not being automatically added, you may have to zap that device.\nIMPORTANT: Prior to zapping any device please ensure it is not being used.\n  Check to see if the number of devices is less than the number of listed drives or your output from step 1.\nncn-s# ceph orch device ls|grep dev|wc -l 24 If the numbers are equal, but less than the total_osds calculated, then you may need to fail your ceph-mgr daemon to get a fresh inventory.\nncn-s# ceph mgr fail $(ceph mgr dump | jq -r .active_name) Give it 5 minutes then re-check ceph orch device ls to see if the drives are still showing as available.

Validate Management Node Deployment Do all of the validation steps. The optional validation steps are manual steps which could be skipped.\n5.1 Validation The following csi pit validate commands will run a series of remote tests on the other nodes to validate they are healthy and configured correctly.\nObserve the output of the checks and note any failures, then remediate them.\n  Check the storage nodes.\npit# csi pit validate --ceph | tee csi-pit-validate-ceph.log Once that command has finished, check the last line of output to see the results of the tests.\nExample last line of output:\nTotal Tests: 7, Total Passed: 7, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 1.4226 seconds If the test total line reports any failed tests, look through the full output of the test in csi-pit-validate-ceph.log to see which node had the failed test and what the details are for that test.\nNote: Please see Utility Storage to help resolve any failed tests.\n  Check the master and worker nodes.\nNote: Throughout the output of the csi pit validate command there will be a test total for each node where the tests run. Be sure to check all of them and not just the final one. (a grep command is provided to help with this)\npit# csi pit validate --k8s | tee csi-pit-validate-k8s.log Once that command has finished, the following will extract the test totals reported for each node:\npit# grep \u0026#34;Total Test\u0026#34; csi-pit-validate-k8s.log Example output for a system with 5 master and worker nodes (other than the PIT node):\nTotal Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3072 seconds Total Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2727 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2841 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3622 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2353 seconds If these total lines report any failed tests, look through the full output of the test to see which node had the failed test and what the details are for that test.\n WARNING If there are failures for tests with names like Worker Node CONLIB FS Label, then manual tests should be run on the node which reported the failure. See Manual LVM Check Procedure. If the manual tests fail, then the problem must be resolved before continuing to the next step. See LVM Check Failure Recovery.\n   Ensure that weave has not become split-brained.\nTo ensure that weave is operating as a single cluster, run the following command on each member of the Kubernetes cluster (master nodes and worker nodes but not the PIT node):\nncn# weave --local status connections | grep failed If the check is successful, there will be no output. If you see messages like IP allocation was seeded by different peers, then weave looks to have split-brained. At this point, it is necessary to wipe the NCNs and start the PXE boot again:\n Wipe the NCNs using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation.

	"content": "Collecting NCN MAC Addresses This procedure will detail how to collect the NCN MAC addresses from an HPE Cray EX system. The MAC addresses needed for the Bootstrap MAC, Bond0 MAC0, and Bond0 MAC1 columns in ncn_metadata.csv will be collected.\nThe Bootstrap MAC address will be used for identification of this node during the early part of the PXE boot process before the bonded interface can be established.\nThe Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 are the MAC addresses for the physical interfaces that the node will use for the various VLANs. The Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 should be on the different network cards to establish redundancy for a failed network card. On the other hand, if the node has only a single network card, then MAC1 and MAC0 will still produce a valid configuration if they do reside on the same physical card.\nSections  Collecting NCN MAC Addresses - Sections  Procedure: iPXE Consoles  Requirements MAC Collection   Procedure: Serial Consoles Procedure: Recovering from an incorrect ncn_metadata.csv file    The easy way to do this leverages the NIC-dump provided by the metal-ipxe package. This page will walk-through booting NCNs and collecting their MACs from the ConMan console logs.\n The alternative is to use serial cables (or SSH) to collect the MACs from the switch ARP tables, this can become exponentially difficult for large systems. If this is the only way, please proceed to the bottom of this page.\n Procedure: iPXE Consoles This procedure is faster for those with the LiveCD (CRAY Pre-Install Toolkit). It can be used to quickly boot-check nodes to dump network device information without an operating system. This works by accessing the PCI Configuration Space.\nRequirements  If CSI does not work because of a file requirement, please file a ticket. By default, dnsmasq and ConMan are already running on the LiveCD, but bond0 needs to be configured. dnsmasq needs to serve/listen over bond0, and ConMan needs the BMC information.\n  LiveCD dnsmasq is configured for the bond0/metal network (NMN/HMN/CAN do not matter) BMC MAC addresses already collected LiveCD ConMan is configured for each BMC  For help with either of those, see LiveCD Setup.\nMAC Collection   (Optional) Shim the boot so nodes bail after dumping their network devices.\nRemoving the iPXE script will prevent network booting.

	"content": "Configure Administrative Access There are several operations which configure administrative access to different parts of the system. Ensuring that the cray CLI can be used by administrative credentials enables use of many management services via commands. The management nodes can be locked from accidental manipulation by the cray capmc and cray fas commands when the intent is to work on the entire system except the management nodes. The cray scsd command can change the SSH keys, NTP server, syslog server, and BMC/controller passwords.\nTopics  Configure Keycloak Account Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (cray CLI) Set Management Role on the BMCs of Management Nodes Lock Management Nodes Configure BMC and Controller Parameters with SCSD Configure Non-compute Nodes with CFS Upload Olympus BMC Recovery Firmware into TFTP server Next Topic  NOTE: The procedures in this section of installation documentation are intended to be done in order, even though the topics are administrative or operational procedures. The topics themselves do not have navigational links to the next topic in the sequence.\nDetails \n  Configure Keycloak Account\nUpcoming steps in the installation workflow require an account to be configured in Keycloak for authentication. This can be either a local keycloak account or an external Identity Provider (IdP), such as LDAP. Having an account in keycloak with administrative credentials enables the use of many management services via the cray command.\nSee Configure Keycloak Account \n  Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (cray CLI)\nThe cray command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management REST APIs into easily usable commands.\nLater procedures in the installation workflow use the cray command to interact with multiple services. The cray CLI configuration needs to be initialized for the Linux account. The Keycloak user who initializes the CLI configuration needs to be authorized for administrative actions.\nSee Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (cray CLI) \n  Set Management Role on the BMCs of Management Nodes\nThe BMCs that control management nodes will not have been marked with the Management role in HSM. It is important to mark them with the Management role so they can be easily included in the locking/unlocking operations required as protections for FAS and CAPMC actions. Set BMC Management Roles Now!\nSee Set BMC Management Role\nFor more info on the importance of locking these components, see Lock Management Nodes.\n  \n  Lock Management Nodes\nThe management nodes are unlocked at this point in the installation. Locking the management nodes and their BMCs will prevent actions from FAS to update their firmware or CAPMC to power off or do a power reset. Doing any of these by accident will take down a management node. If the management node is a Kubernetes master or worker node, this can have serious negative effects on system operation.\nIf a single node is taken down by mistake, it is possible that things will recover. However, if all management nodes are taken down, or all Kubernetes worker nodes are taken down by mistake, the system is dead and has to be completely restarted. Lock the management nodes now!\nRun the lock_management_nodes.py script to lock all management nodes and their BMCs that are not already locked:\nncn# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/admin_access/lock_management_nodes.py The return value of the script is 0 if locking was successful. Otherwise, a non-zero return means that manual intervention may be needed to lock the nodes and their BMCs.\nFor more information see Lock and Unlock Nodes \n  Configure BMC and Controller Parameters with SCSD\nNOTE: If there are no liquid-cooled cabinets present in the HPE Cray EX system, then this step can be skipped.\nThe System Configuration Service (SCSD) allows administrators to set various BMC and controller parameters for components in liquid-cooled cabinets. At this point in the install, SCSD should be used to set the SSH key in the node controllers (BMCs) to enable troubleshooting. If any of the nodes fail to power down or power up as part of the compute node booting process, it may be necessary to look at the logs on the BMC for node power down or node power up.\nSee Configure BMC and Controller Parameters with SCSD \n  Configure Non-compute Nodes with CFS\nNon-compute Nodes (NCN) need to be configured after booting for administrative access, security, and other purposes. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is used to apply post-boot configuration in a decoupled, layered manner. Individual software products including CSM provide one or more layers of configuration in a process called \u0026ldquo;NCN personalization\u0026rdquo;.\nSee Configure Non-Compute Nodes with CFS \n  Upload Olympus BMC Recovery Firmware into TFTP server\nThe Olympus hardware (NodeBMCs, ChassisBMCs, RouterBMCs) needs to have recovery firmware loaded to the cray-tftp server in case the BMC loses its firmware. The BMCs are configured to load a recovery firmware from a TFTP server. This procedure does not modify any BMC firmware, but only stages the firmware on the TFTP server for download in the event it is needed.\nSee Load Olympus BMC Recovery Firmware into TFTP server \n  Next Topic\nAfter completing the operational procedures above which configure administrative access, the next step is to validate the health of management nodes and CSM services.\nSee Validate CSM Health\n  "

Switch IP addresses are generated by Cray Site Init (CSI).\nDocumentation for the Management Network can be found in the HPE Cray EX Management Network Installation and Configuration Guide.\nThe configuration for these switches will be generated from CSM Automated Network Utility (CANU) Documentation for CANU can be found at https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu\nIt is assumed that the administrator configuring the Management Network has a basic understanding of networking protocols (STP, VLAN, OSPF, LAG/MLAG, BGP, etc.), and knows how to configure network equipment. It is also assumed that they understand and know how to read an SHCD file.\nBefore configuring/reconfiguring any switches, make sure to get the current running configuration and save that in case the configuration must be reverted.\nAll switch configuration should be done with a console or out of band connection.\nSave the output of the following:\n# show run Details HPE Aruba Switch Configuration The management network switches should be configured in this order: Spine, Leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and Leaf-BMC. Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled cabinets will have Leaf switches.\nDell and Mellanox Switch Configuration The management network switches should be configured in this order: Spine, Leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and Leaf-BMC. Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled cabinets will have Leaf switches.\nOn a typical system, the Mellanox switches are Spine switches and the Dell switches are used for Leaf, CDU, and Leaf-BMC switches.\nSite Connections Currently CANU does not automatically create site connections (LAGs/uplink interfaces or default routes).\nHence, administrators need to manually configure the uplinks for site connections as well as default routes.\nExample configuration:\nNOTE: These are very simplistic examples and depending on the install scenario, administrators may need to also configure LAGs, etc.\nMellanox\nsw-spine-001 [standalone: master] \u0026gt; ena sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # conf t sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet 1/16 no switchport force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet 1/16 speed 10G force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet 1/16 vrf forwarding Customer sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet 1/16 ip address 10.102.255.10/30 primary sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # ip route vrf Customer 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.3.3 sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # ip route vrf Customer 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.255.9 Aruba\nsw-spine-001# config sw-spine-001(config)# Interface 1/1/16 sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# vrf attach Customer sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# ip address 10.102.255.10/30 sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# no shutdown sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# exit sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.3.3 vrf Customer sw-spine-001(int-1/1/16)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 0.102.255.9 vrf Customer Next Topic After completing this procedure, collect MAC Addresses for the management nodes using the PIT node and the management network switches configured in this procedure.\n See Collect Mac Addresses  "

There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node: the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. This procedure describes using the USB device. If not using the RemoteISO, see Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB\nThe installation process is similar to the USB-based installation, with adjustments to account for the lack of removable storage.\nImportant: Before starting this procedure be sure to complete the procedure to Prepare Configuration Payload for the relevant installation scenario.\nTopics  Known Compatibility Issues Attaching and Booting the LiveCD with the BMC First Login Configure the Running LiveCD  Generate Installation Files  Subsequent Installs (Reinstalls) Initial Installs (bare-metal)   Verify and Backup system_config.yaml Prepare Site Init   Bring-up the PIT Services and Validate PIT Health Next Topic  1.

Instead use Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB Gigabyte nodes should not attempt to bootstrap using the LiveCD Remote ISO method. Instead use Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB  2. Attaching and Booting the LiveCD with the BMC  Warning: If this is a re-installation on a system that still has a USB device from a prior installation, then that USB device must be wiped before continuing. Failing to wipe the USB, if present, may result in confusion. If the USB is still booted, then it can wipe itself using the basic wipe from Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation.\n Obtain and attach the LiveCD cray-pre-install-toolkit ISO file to the BMC. Depending on the vendor of the node, the instructions for attaching to the BMC will differ.\n  Download the CSM software release and extract the LiveCD remote ISO image.\nImportant: Ensure that you have the CSM release plus any patches or hotfixes by following the instructions in Update CSM Product Stream\nThe cray-pre-install-toolkit ISO and other files are now available in the directory from the extracted CSM tar file.

Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on this node connected to the site. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes   If one are not using a cabinets-yaml file, set the three cabinet parameters (mountain-cabinets, hill-cabinets, and river-cabinets) to the number of each cabinet which are part of this system. The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help For systems that use non-sequential cabinet ID numbers, use cabinets-yaml to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file can include information about the starting ID for each cabinet type and number of cabinets which have separate command line options, but is a way to specify explicitly the id of every cabinet in the system. If one are using a cabinets-yaml file, flags specified on the csi command-line related to cabinets will be ignored. See Create Cabinets YAML. An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters.

This is because after booting from the PIT node, some paths will be different.\nThe echo prepends a newline to ensure that the variable assignment occurs on a unique line, and not at the end of another line.\n linux# echo \u0026#34; CSM_PATH=/var/www/ephemeral/${CSM_RELEASE}CSM_RELEASE=${CSM_RELEASE}PITDATA=/var/www/ephemeral SYSTEM_NAME=${SYSTEM_NAME}\u0026#34; | tee -a /mnt/cow/rw/etc/environment   Unmount the overlay.\nlinux# umount -v /mnt/cow   Copy the NCN artifacts.\n  Copy Kubernetes node artifacts:\nlinux# csi pit populate pitdata \u0026#34;${CSM_PATH}/images/kubernetes/\u0026#34; ${PITDATA}/data/k8s/ -kiK Expected output looks similar to the following:\n5.3.18-24.37-default-0.0.6.kernel-----------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/k8s/...OK initrd.img-0.0.6.xz-------------------------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/k8s/...OK kubernetes-0.0.6.squashfs-------------------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/k8s/...OK   Copy Ceph/storage node artifacts:\nlinux# csi pit populate pitdata \u0026#34;${CSM_PATH}/images/storage-ceph/\u0026#34; ${PITDATA}/data/ceph/ -kiC Expected output looks similar to the following:\n5.3.18-24.37-default-0.0.5.kernel-----------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/ceph/...OK initrd.img-0.0.5.xz-------------------------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/ceph/...OK storage-ceph-0.0.5.squashfs-----------------------\u0026gt; /mnt/pitdata/data/ceph/...OK     Quit the typescript session with the exit command and copy the typescript file to the data partition on the USB drive.\nlinux# exit linux# cp -v ${SCRIPT_FILE} ${PITDATA}/prep/admin   Unmount the data partition:\nlinux# cd; umount -v ${PITDATA}   Move the USB device to the system to be installed, if needed.\nIf the USB device was created somewhere other than ncn-m001 of the system to be installed, move it there from its current location.\n  Proceed to the next step to boot into the LiveCD image.\n  5. Boot the LiveCD Some systems will boot the USB device automatically if no other OS exists (bare-metal). Otherwise the administrator may need to use the BIOS Boot Selection menu to choose the USB device.\nIf an administrator has the node booted with an operating system which will next be rebooting into the LiveCD, then use efibootmgr to set the boot order to be the USB device. See the set boot order page for more information about how to set the boot order to have the USB device first.\n Note: UEFI booting must be enabled in order for the system to find the USB device\u0026rsquo;s EFI bootloader.\n   Start a typescript on an external system.\nThis will record this section of activities done on the console of ncn-m001 using IPMI.\nexternal# script -a boot.livecd.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt external# export PS1=\u0026#39;\\u@\\H \\D{%Y-%m-%d} \\t \\w # \u0026#39;   Confirm that the IPMI credentials work for the BMC by checking the power status.\nSet the BMC variable to the hostname or IP address of the BMC of the PIT node.\n read -s is used in order to prevent the credentials from being displayed on the screen or recorded in the shell history.\n external# BMC=eniac-ncn-m001-mgmt external# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD external# export IPMI_PASSWORD ; ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H ${BMC} chassis power status   Connect to the IPMI console.\nexternal# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H ${BMC} sol activate   Reboot ncn-m001.\nncn-m001# reboot   Watch the shutdown and boot from the ipmitool console session.\n An integrity check runs before Linux starts by default; it can be skipped by selecting OK in its prompt.\n   5.1 First Login On first log in (over SSH or at local console), the LiveCD will prompt the administrator to change the password.\n  The initial password is empty; enter the username of root and press return twice.\npit login: root Expected output looks similar to the following:\nPassword: \u0026lt;-------just press Enter here for a blank password You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced) Changing password for root.

See Reset root Password on LiveCD for information on clearing the password.\n   Disconnect from IPMI console.\nOnce the network is up so that SSH to the node works, disconnect from the IPMI console.\nYou can disconnect from the IPMI console by entering ~.; That is, the tilde character followed by a period character.\n  Exit the typescript started on the external system and use scp to transfer it to the PIT node.\n Set PIT_NODE variable to the site IP address or hostname of the PIT node.\n external# exit external# PIT_NODE=eniac-ncn-m001 external# scp boot.livecd.*.txt root@${PIT_NODE}:/root   Log in to the PIT node as root using ssh.\nexternal# ssh root@${PIT_NODE}   Mount the data partition.\nThe data partition is set to fsopt=noauto to facilitate LiveCDs over virtual-ISO mount. Therefore, USB installations need to mount this manually by running the following command.\n Note: When creating the USB PIT image, this was mounted over /mnt/pitdata. Now that the USB PIT is booted, it will mount over /var/www/ephemeral. The FSLabel PITDATA is already in /etc/fstab, so the path is omitted in the following call to mount.\n pit# mount -vL PITDATA   Start a typescript to record this section of activities done on ncn-m001 while booted from the LiveCD.\npit# script -af /var/www/ephemeral/prep/admin/booted-csm-livecd.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt pit# export PS1=\u0026#39;\\u@\\H \\D{%Y-%m-%d} \\t \\w # \u0026#39;   Verify that expected environment variables are set in the new login shell.\nThese were written into /etc/environment on the USB PIT image earlier in this procedure, before it was booted.\npit# echo -e \u0026#34;CSM_PATH=${CSM_PATH}\\nCSM_RELEASE=${CSM_RELEASE}\\nPITDATA=${PITDATA}\\nSYSTEM_NAME=${SYSTEM_NAME}\u0026#34;   Copy the typescript made on the external system into the PITDATA mount.\npit# cp -v /root/boot.livecd.*.txt ${PITDATA}/prep/admin   Check hostname.\npit# hostnamectl  Note: The hostname should be similar to eniac-ncn-m001-pit when booted from the LiveCD, but it will be shown as pit# in the documentation command prompts from this point onward.\n  Note: If the hostname returned by the hostnamectl command is pit, then set the hostname manually with hostnamectl. In that case, be sure to append the -pit suffix to prevent masquerading a PIT node as a real NCN to administrators and automation.\n   Print information about the booted PIT image.\nThere is nothing in the output that needs to be verified. This is run in order to ensure the information is recorded in the typescript file, in case it is needed later. For example, this information is useful to include in any bug reports or service queries for issues encountered on the PIT node.\npit# /root/bin/metalid.sh Expected output looks similar to the following:\n= PIT Identification = COPY/CUT START ======================================= VERSION=1.5.7 TIMESTAMP=20211028194247 HASH=ge4aceb1 CRAY-Site-Init build signature...

	"content": "Cray System Management Documentation Scope and Audience The documentation included here describes the Cray System Management (CSM) software, how to install or upgrade CSM software, and related supporting operational procedures to manage an HPE Cray EX system. CSM software is the foundation upon which other software product streams for the HPE Cray EX system depend.\nThe CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment via Helm charts. Kubernetes orchestrates these services and schedules them on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling. Horizontal scales increases or decreases the number of service instances as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nThis information is intended for system installers, system administrators, and network administrators of the system. It assumes some familiarity with standard Linux and open source tools, such as shell scripts, revision control with git, configuration management with Ansible, YAML, JSON, and TOML file formats, etc.\nTable of Contents   Introduction to CSM Installation\nThis chapter provides an introduction to using the CSM software to manage the HPE Cray EX system which also describes the scenarios for installation and upgrade of CSM software, how product stream updates for CSM are delivered, the operational activities done after installation for on-going management of the HPE Cray EX system, differences between previous release and this release, and conventions used in this documentation.\n  Pre-Install Steps\nThis chapter outlines how to set up default credentials for River BMCs and ServerTech PDUs, which must be done before the initial installation of CSM, in order to enable HSM software to interact with River Redfish BMCs and PDUs.\n  Update CSM Product Stream\nThis chapter explains how to get the CSM product release, get any patches, update to the latest documentation, and check for any Field Notices or Hotfixes.\n  Install CSM\nThis chapter provides an order list of procedures which can be used for CSM software installation or reinstall that indicate when to do operational tasks as part of the installation workflow. Updating software is in another chapter. Installation of the CSM product stream has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order. Information about the HPE Cray EX system and the site is used to prepare the configuration payload. The initial node used to bootstrap the installation process is called the PIT node because the Pre-Install Toolkit is installed there. Once the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed with an operating system and the software to create a Kubernetes cluster utilizing Ceph storage. The CSM services provide essential software infrastructure including the API gateway and many micro-services with REST APIs for managing the system. Once administrative access has been configured, the installation of CSM software and nodes can be validated with health checks before doing operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components or the preparation of compute nodes.\n  Upgrade CSM\nThis chapter provides an order list of procedures which can be used to update CSM software that indicate when to do operational tasks as part of the software upgrade workflow. There are procedures to prepare the HPE Cray system for the upgrade, and update the management network, the management nodes, and the CSM services. After the upgrade of CSM software, the CSM health checks are used to validate the system before doing any other operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components.\n  CSM Operational Activities\nThis chapter provides an unordered set of administrative procedures required to operate an HPE Cray EX system with CSM software and grouped into several major areas:\n CSM Product Management Artifact Management Boot Orchestration Compute Rolling Upgrade Configuration Management Console Management Firmware Management Hardware State Manager Image Management Kubernetes Network Management Node Management Package Repository Management Power Management Resiliency River Endpoint Discovery Service Security And Authentication System Configuration Service System Layout Service System Management Health UAS User And Admin Topics Utility Storage Validate CSM Health    CSM Troubleshooting Information\nThis chapter provides information about some known issues in the system and tips for troubleshooting Kubernetes.\n  CSM Background Information\nThis chapter provides background information about the NCNs (non-compute nodes) which function as management nodes for the HPE Cray EX system. This information is not normally needed to install or upgrade software, but provides background which might be helpful for troubleshooting an installation.\n  Glossary\nThis chapter provides explanations of terms and acronyms used throughout the rest of this documentation.\n  Copyright and License MIT License\n(C) Copyright [2020-2022] Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026ldquo;Software\u0026rdquo;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026ldquo;AS IS\u0026rdquo;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The AN is not part of the Kubernetes cluster to which management nodes belong. One special type of AN is the UAN (User Access Node), but different systems may have need for other types of ANs, such as:\n nodes which provide a Lustre routing function (LNet router) gateways between HSN and Infiniband data movers between two different network file systems visualization servers other special-purpose nodes  Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) Air-Cooled cabinet COTS servers that include a Redfish-enabled baseboard management controller (BMC) and REST endpoint for API control and management. Either IPMI commands or REST API calls can be used to manage a BMC.\nBlade Switch Controller (sC) The Slingshot blade switch embedded controller (sC) provides a hardware management REST endpoint to monitor environmental conditions and manage the blade power, switch ASIC, FPGA buffer/interfaces, and firmware.\nBoot Script Service (BSS) The Boot Script Service stores the configuration information that is used to boot each hardware component. Nodes consult BSS for their boot artifacts and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot.\nBoot Orchestration Service (BOS) The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. This is accomplished using BOS components, such as boot orchestration session templates and sessions, as well as launching a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) that fulfills boot requests. BOS uses other services which provide boot artifact configuration (BSS), power control (CAPMC), node status (HSM), and configuration (CFS).\nCabinet Cooling Group A cabinet cooling group is a group of Olympus cabinets that are connected to a floor-standing coolant distribution unit (CDU). Management network CDU switches in the CDU aggregate all the node management network (NMN) and hardware management network (HMN) connections for the cabinet group.\nCabinet Environmental Controller (CEC) The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet environmental controller (CEC) sets the cabinet\u0026rsquo;s geolocation, monitors environmental sensors, and communicates status to the cooling distribution unit (CDU). The CEC microcontroller (eC) signals the cooling distribution unit (CDU) to start liquid cooling and then enables the DC rectifiers so that a chassis can be powered on. The CEC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet, it simply provides the cabinet environmental and CDU status to the CMM for evaluation or action; the CEC takes no action. The CEC firmware is flashed automatically when the CMM firmware is flashed. If there are momentary erroneous signals because of a CEC reset or cable disconnection, the system can ride through these events without issuing an EPO.\nCEC microcontroller (eC) The CEC microcontroller (eC) sets the cabinet\u0026rsquo;s geolocation, monitors the cabinet environmental sensors, and communicates cabinet status to the cooling distribution unit (CDU). The eC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet as do other embedded controllers, but simply monitors the cabinet sensors and provides the cabinet environmental and CDU status to the CMMs for evaluation and/or action.\nCray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) The Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service enables direct hardware control of power on/off, power monitoring, or system-wide power telemetry and configuration parameters from Redfish. CAPMC implements a simple interface for powering on/off compute nodes and application nodes, querying node state information, and querying site-specific service usage rules. These controls enable external software to more intelligently manage system-wide power consumption or configuration parameters.\nCray CLI (cray) The cray command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management REST APIs into easily usable commands.\nCustomer Access Network The Customer Access Network (CAN) provides access from outside the customer network to services, noncompute nodes (NCNs), and User Access Nodes (UANs) in the system. This allows for the following:\n Clients outside of the system:  Log in to each of the NCNs and UANs. Access web UIs within the system (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, and more). Access the Rest APIs within the system. Access a DNS server within the system for resolution of names for the webUI and REST API services. Run Cray CLI commands from outside the system. Access the User Access Instances (UAI).   NCNs and UANs to access systems outside the cluster (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more). Services within the cluster to access systems outside the cluster.  These nodes and services need an IP address that routes to the customer\u0026rsquo;s network in order to be accessed from outside the network.\nChassis Management Module (CMM) The cabinet chassis management module (CMM) provides a REST endpoint via its chassis controller (cC). The CMM is an embedded controller that monitors and controls all the blades in a chassis. Each chassis supports 8 compute blades and 8 switches and associated rectifiers/PSUs in the rectifier shelf. Power Considerations - Two CMMs in adjacent chassis share power from the rectifier shelf (a shelf connects two adjacent chassis - 0/1, 2/3, 4/5, 6/7). If both CMMs sharing shelf power are both enabling the rectifiers, one of the CMMs can be removed (but only one at a time) without the rectifier shelf powering off. Removing a CMM will shutdown all compute blades and switches in the chassis. Cooling Considerations - Any single CMM in any cabinet can enable CDU cooling. Note that the CDU \u0026ldquo;enable path\u0026rdquo; has vertical control which means CMMs 0/2/4/6 and CEC0 are in a path (half of the cabinet), and CMMs 1/3/5/7 and CEC1 are in another path. Any CMM or CEC in the same half-cabinet path can be removed and CDU cooling will stay enabled as long as the other CMMs/CEC enables CDU cooling.\nCompute Node (CN) The compute node (CN) is where high performance computing application are run. These have hostnames that are of the form \u0026ldquo;nidXXXXXX\u0026rdquo;, that is, \u0026ldquo;nid\u0026rdquo; followed by six digits. where the XXXXXX is a six digit number starting with zero padding.\nConfiguration Framework Service (CFS) The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is available on systems for remote execution and configuration management of nodes and boot images. This includes nodes available in the Hardware State Manager (HSM) service inventory (compute, management, and application nodes), and boot images hosted by the Image Management Service (IMS).\nCFS configures nodes and images via a gitops methodology. All configuration content is stored in a version control service (VCS), and is managed by authorized system administrators. CFS provides a scalable Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) for the configuration to be applied with flexible inventory and node targeting options.\nContent Projection Service (CPS) The Content Projection Service (CPS) provides the root filesystem for compute nodes and application nodes in conjunction with the Data Virtualization Service (DVS). Using CPS and DVS, the Cray Programming Environment (CPE) and Analytics products are provided as separately mounted filesystems to compute nodes, application nodes (such as UANs), and worker nodes hosting UAI pods.\nCray Site Init (CSI) The Cray Site Init (CSI) program creates, validates, installs, and upgrades an HPE Cray EX system. CSI can prepare the LiveCD for booting the PIT node and then is used from a booted PIT node to do its other functions during an installation. During an upgrade, CSI is installed on one of the nodes to facilitate the CSM software upgrade.\nCray System Management (CSM) Cray System Management (CSM) refers to the product stream which provides the infrastructure to manage an HPE Cray EX system using Kubernetes to manage the containerized workload of layered micro-services with well-defined REST APIs which provide the ability to discover and control the hardware platform, manage configuration of the system, configure the network, boot nodes, gather log and telemetry data, connect API access and user level access to Identity Providers (IdPs), and provide a method for system administrators and end-users to access the HPE Cray EX system.\nData Virtualization Service (DVS) The Data Virtualization Service (DVS) is a distributed network service that projects file systems mounted on non-compute nodes (NCN) to other nodes within the HPE Cray EX system. Projecting is the process of making a file system available on nodes where it does not physically reside. DVS-specific configuration settings enable clients to access a file system projected by DVS servers. These clients include compute nodes, User Access Nodes (UANs), and other management nodes running User Access Instances (UAIs). Thus DVS, while not a file system, represents a software layer that provides scalable transport for file system services. DVS is integrated with the Content Projection Service (CPS).\nEX Compute Cabinet A Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute blades and 64 high-speed network (HSN) switches.\nImage Management Service (IMS) The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from recipes. IMS also uses CFS to apply image customization for pre-boot configuration of the image root. These images are bootable on compute nodes and application nodes.\nEX TDS Cabinet A Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 2-chassis, 16 compute blades and 16 high-speed network (HSN) switches, and includes a rack-mounted 4U coolant distribution unit (MCDU-4U).\nFabric The Slingshot fabric consists of the switches, cables, ports, topology policy, and configuration settings for the Slingshot high-speed network.\nFloor Standing CDU A floor-standing coolant distribution unit (CDU) pumps liquid coolant through a cabinet group or cabinet chilled doors.\nHardware Management Network (HMN) The hardware management network (HMN) includes HMS embedded controllers. This includes chassis controllers (cC), node controllers (nC) and switch controllers (sC), for Liquid-Cooled TDS and Liquid-Cooled Olympus systems. For standard rack systems, this includes iPDUs, COTS server BMCs, or any other equipment that requires hardware-management with Redfish. The hardware management network is isolated from all other node management networks. An out-of-band Ethernet management switch and hardware management VLAN is used for customer access and administration of hardware.\nHardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) The Hardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) service receives component state change notifications from the HSM. It fans notifications out to subscribers (typically compute nodes).\nHardware State Manager (HSM) Hardware State Manager (HSM) service monitors and interrogates hardware components in an HPE Cray EX system, tracking hardware state and inventory information, and making it available via REST queries and message bus events when changes occur.\nHeartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD) The Heartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD) service listens for heartbeats from components (mainly compute nodes). It tracks changes in heartbeats and conveys changes to HSM.\nHigh Speed Network (HSN) The High Speed Network (HSN) in an HPE Cray EX system is based on the Slingshot switches.\nKubernetes NCNs The Kubernetes NCNs are the management nodes which are known as Kubernetes master nodes (ncn-mXXX) or Kubernetes worker nodes (ncn-wXXX). The only type of management node which is excluded from this is the utility storage node (ncn-sXXX).\nLiveCD The LiveCD has a complete bootable Linux operating system that can be run from a read-only CD or DVD, a writable USB flash drive, or a hard disk. It is used to bootstrap the installation process for CSM software. It contains the Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT). The node which boots from it during the install is known as the PIT node.\nManagement Cabinet At least one 19 inch IEA management cabinet is required for every HPE Cray EX system to support the management non-compute nodes (NCN), system management network, utility storage, and other support equipment. This cabinet serves as the primary customer access point for managing the system.\nManagement Nodes The management nodes are one grouping of NCNs. The management nodes include the master nodes with hostnames of the form of ncn-mXXX, the worker nodes with hostnames of the form ncn-wXXX, and utility storage nodes, with hostnames of the form ncn-sXXX, where the XXX is a three digit number starting with zero padding. The utility storage nodes provide Ceph storage for use by the management nodes. The master nodes provide Kubernetes master functions and have the etcd cluster which provides a datastore for Kubernetes. The worker nodes provide Kubernetes worker functions where most of the containerized workload is scheduled by Kubernetes.\nMountain Cabinet See Olympus cabinet. Some software and documentation refers to the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.\nMountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) The Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of Redfish-enabled BMCs in liquid-cooled Olympus cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if hardware is present or missing.\nNIC Mezzanine Card (NMC) The NIC mezzanine card (NMC) attaches to two host port connections on a liquid-cooled compute blade node card and provides the high-speed network (HSN) controllers (NICs). There are typically two or four NICs on each node card. NMCs connect to the rear panel EXAMAX connectors on the compute blade through an internal L0 cable assembly in a single-, dual-, or quad-injection bandwidth configuration depending on the design of the node card.\nNode Controller (nC) Each compute blade node card includes an embedded node controller (nC) and REST endpoint to manage the node environmental conditions, power, HMS nFPGA interface, and firmware.\nNode Management Network The node management network (NMN) communicates with motherboard PCH-style hosts, typically 10GbE Ethernet LAN-on-motherboard (LOM) interfaces. This network supports node boot protocols (DHCP/TFTP/HTTP), in-band telemetry and event exchange, and general access to management REST APIs.\nNon-Compute Node (NCN) Any node which is not a compute node may be called a Non-Compute Node (NCN). The NCNs include management nodes and application nodes.\nOlympus Cabinet The Olympus cabinet is a liquid-cooled dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute blades and 64 high-speed network (HSN) switches. Every HPE Cray EX system with Olympus cabinets will also have at least one River cabinet to house non-compute node components such as management nodes, management network switches, storage nodes, application nodes, and possibly other air-cooled compute nodes. Some software and documentation refers to the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.\nPower Distribution Unit (PDU) The cabinet PDU receives 480VAC 3-phase facility power and provides circuit breaker, fuse protection, and EMI filtered power to the rectifier/power supplies that distribute ±190VDC (HVDC) to a chassis. PDUs are passive devices that do not connect to the SMNet.\nPre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node The Pre-Install Toolkit is installed onto the initial node used as the inception node during software installation which is booted from a LiveCD. This is the node that will eventually become ncn-m001. The node running the Pre-Install Toolkit is known as the PIT node during the installation process until it reboots from a normal management node image like the other master nodes.\nEarly in the install process, before the Pre-Install Toolkit has been installed or booted, the documents may still refer to the PIT node. In this case, they are referring to the node which will eventually become the PIT node.\nIn this documentation, PIT node and LiveCD are sometimes used interchangeably.\nRack-Mounted CDU The rack-mounted coolant distribution unit (MCDU-4U) pumps liquid coolant through the Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet coolant manifolds.\nRack System Compute Cabinet Air-Cooled compute cabinets house a cluster of compute nodes, Slingshot ToR switches, and SMNet ToR switches.\nRedfish Translation Service (RTS) The Redfish Translation Service (RTS) aids in management of any hardware components which are not managed by Redfish, such as a ServerTech PDU in a River Cabinet.\nRiver Cabinet At least one 19 inch IEA management cabinet is required for every HPE Cray EX system to support the management non-compute nodes (NCN), system management network, utility storage, and other support equipment. Additional River cabinets may be included to house storage storage or compute nodes which are not in an Olympus liquid-cooled cabinet.\nRiver Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) The River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of Redfish-enabled BMCs in air-cooled River cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if hardware is present or missing.\nRosetta ASIC The Rosetta ASIC is a 64-port switch chip that forms the foundation for the Slingshot network. Each port can operate at either 100G or 200G. Each network edge port supports IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, optimized-IP based protocols, and portals (an enhanced frame format that supports higher rates of small messages).\nService/IO Cabinet An Air-Cooled service/IO cabinet houses a cluster of NCN servers, Slingshot ToR switches, and management network ToR switches to support the managed ecosystem storage, network, user access services (UAS), and other IO services such as LNet and gateways.\nSlingshot Slingshot supports L1 and L2 network connectivity between 200Gbs switch ports and L0 connectivity from a single 200Gbs port to two 100Gbs Mellanox ConnectX-5 NICs. Slingshot also supports edge ports and link aggregation groups (LAG) to external storage systems or networks.\n IEEE 802.3cd/bs (200 Gbps) Ethernet over 4 x 50 Gb/s (PAM-4) lanes 200GBASE-DR4, 500m singlemode fiber 200GBASE-SR4, 100m multi-mode fiber 200GBASE-CR4, 3m copper cable IEEE 802.3cd (100 Gbps) Ethernet over 2 x 50 Gb/s (PAM-4) lanes 100GBASE-SR2, 100m multimode fiber 100GBASE-CR2, 3m copper cable IEEE 802.3 2018 100 Gbps Ethernet over 4 x 25 Gb/s (NRZ) lanes 100GBASE-CR4, 5m copper cable 100GBASE-SR4, 100m multi-mode fiber Optimized Ethernet and HPC fabric formats Lossy and lossless delivery Flow control, 802.1x (PAUSE), 802.1p (PFC), credit based flow control on fabric links, fine-grain flow control on host links and edge ports, Link level retry, low latency FEC, Ethernet physical interfaces:  Slingshot Blade Switch The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet blade switch supports one switch ASIC and 48 fabric ports. Eight connectors on the rear panel connect orthogonally to each compute blade then to NIC mezzanine cards (NMCs) inside the compute blade. Each rear panel EXAMAX connector supports two switch ports (a total of 16 fabric ports per blade). Twelve QSFP-DD cages on the front panel (4 fabric ports per QSFP-DD cage), fan out 48 external fabric ports to other switches. The front-panel top ports support passive electrical cables (PEC) or active optical cables (AOC). The front-panel bottom ports support only PECs for proper cooling in the blade enclosure.\nSlingshot Top of Rack (ToR) Switch A standard River cabinet can support one, two, or four, rack-mounted Slingshot ToR switches. Each switch supports a total of 64 fabric ports. 32 QSFP-DD connectors on the front panel connect 64 ports to the fabric. All front-panel connectors support either passive electrical cables (PEC) or active optical cables (AOC).\nShasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) The Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) is a multiple tab spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing with information about the components in an HPE Cray EX system. This document has much information about the system. Included in the SHCD are a configuration summary with revision history, floor layout plan, type and location of components in the air-cooled cabinets, type and location of components in the liquid-cooled cabinets, device diagrams for switches and nodes in the cabinets, list of source and destination of every HSN cable, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the spine switches, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the NMN, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the HMN. list of cabling for the KVM, and routing of power to the PDUs.\nSupply/Return Cutoff Valves Manual coolant supply and return shutoff valves at the top of each cabinet can be closed to isolate a single cabinet from the other cabinets in the cooling group for maintenance. If the valves are closed during operation, the action automatically causes the CMMs to remove ±190VDC from each chassis in the cabinet because of the loss of coolant pressure.\nSystem Admin Toolkit (SAT) The System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product provides the sat command line interface which interacts with the REST APIs of many services to perform more complex system management tasks.\nSystem Layout Service (SLS) The System Layout Service (SLS) serves as a \u0026ldquo;single source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the system design. It details the physical locations of network hardware, management nodes, application nodes, compute nodes, and cabinets. It also stores information about the network, such as which port on which switch should be connected to each node.\nSystem Management Network (SMNet) The system management network (SMNet) is a dedicated out-of-band (OOB) spine-leaf topology Ethernet network that interconnects all the nodes in the system to management services.\nSystem Management Services (SMS) System Management Services (SMS) leverages open REST APIs, Kubernetes container orchestration, and a pool of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers to manage the system. The management server pool, custom Redfish-enabled embedded controllers, iPDU controllers, and server BMCs are unified under a common software platform that provides 3 levels of management: Level 1 HaaS, Level 2 IaaS, and Level 3 PaaS.\nSystem Management Services (SMS) nodes System Management Services (SMS) nodes provide access to the entire management cluster and Kubernetes container orchestration.\nTop of Rack Switch Controller (sC-ToR) The Air-Cooled cabinet HSN ToR switch embedded controller (sC-ToR) provides a hardware management REST endpoint to monitor the ToR switch environmental conditions and manage the switch power, HSN ASIC, and FPGA interfaces.\nUser Access Instance (UAI) The User Access Instance (UAI) is a lightweight, disposable platform that runs under Kubernetes orchestration on worker nodes. The UAI provides a single user containerized environment for users on a Cray Ex system to develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAN for another way for users to gain access.\nUser Access Node (UAN) The User Access Node (UAN) is an NCN, but is really one of the special types of application nodes. The UAN provides a traditional multi-user Linux environment for users on a Cray Ex system to develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAI for another way for users to gain access. Some sites refer to their UANs as Login nodes.\nUser Access Service (UAS) The User Access Service (UAS) is a containerized service managed by Kubernetes that enables users to create and run user applications inside a UAI. UAS runs on a management node that is acting as a Kubernetes worker node. When a user requests a new UAI, the UAS service returns status and connection information to the newly created UAI. External access to UAS is routed through a node that hosts gateway services.\nVersion Control Service (VCS) The Version Control Service (VCS) provides configuration content to CFS via a gitops methodology based on a git server (gitea) that can be accessed by the git command but also includes a web interface for repository management, pull requests, and a visual view of all repositories and organizations.\nxname Component names (xnames) identify the geolocation for hardware components in the HPE Cray EX system. Every component is uniquely identified by these component names. Some, like the system cabinet number or the CDU number, can be changed by site needs. There is no geolocation encoded within the cabinet number, such as an X-Y coordinate system to relate to the floor layout of the cabinets. Other component names refer to the location within a cabinet and go down to the port on a card or switch or the socket holding a processor or a memory DIMM location. See Component Names (xnames).\n"

	"content": "CSM Background Information This document provides background information about the NCNs (non-compute nodes) which function as management nodes for the HPE Cray EX system. This information is not normally needed to install software, but provides background which might be helpful for troubleshooting an installation.\nTopics:  Cray Site Init Files Certificate Authority NCN Images NCN Boot Workflow NCN Networking NCN Mounts and File Systems NCN Packages NCN Operating System Releases cloud-init Basecamp Configuration  Details Cray Site Init Files The Cray Site Init (csi) command has several files which describe pre-configuration data needed during the installation process:\n application_node_config.yaml cabinets.yaml hmn_connections.json ncn_metadata.csv switch_metadata.csv  In addition, after running csi with those pre-config files, csi creates an output system_config.yaml file which can be passed to csi when reinstalling this software release.\nCertificate Authority While a system is being installed for the first time, a certificate authority (CA) is needed. This can be generated for a system, or one can be supplied from a customer intermediate CA. Outside of a new installation, there is no supported method to rotate or change the platform CA in this release.\nFor more information about these topics, see Certificate Authority\n \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Use Default Platform Generated CA\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Customize Platform Generated CA\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Use an External CA\u0026rdquo;  NCN Images The management nodes boot from NCN images which are created as layers on top of a common base image. The common image is customized with a Kubernetes layer for the master nodes and worker nodes. The common image is also customized with a storage-ceph layer for the utility storage nodes. Three artifacts are needed to boot the management nodes.\nSee NCN Images\nNCN Boot Workflow The boot workflow for management nodes (NCNs) is different from compute nodes or application nodes. They can PXE boot over the network or from local storage.\nSee NCN Boot Workflow for these topics\n How can I tell if I booted via disk or PXE? Set BMCs to DHCP Set Boot Order  Setting Order Trimming Boot Order Examples Reverting Changes Locating USB Device    NCN Networking Non-compute nodes and compute nodes have different network interfaces used for booting. The NCN network interfaces, device naming, and vendor and bus identification are described in this topic.\n NCN Networking  NCN Mounts and File Systems The management nodes have specific file systems and mounts and use overlayfs.\nSee NCN Mounts and File Systems\nNCN Packages The management nodes boot from images which have many (RPM) packages installed. The packages installed differ between the Kubernetes master and worker nodes versus the utility storage nodes.\n NCN Packages  NCN Operating System Releases All management nodes have an operating system based on SLE_HPC (SuSE High Performance Computing).\n NCN Operating System Releases  cloud-init Basecamp Configuration Metal Basecamp is a cloud-init DataSource available on the LiveCD.

This can be generated for a system, or one can be supplied from a customer intermediate CA. Outside of a new installation, there is no supported method to rotate or change the platform CA in this release.\nTopics:  Overview Use Default Platform Generated CA Customize Platform Generated CA Use External CA  Overview At install time, a PKI certificate authority (CA) can either be generated for a system, or a customer can opt to supply their own (intermediate) CA.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Sealed Secrets, part of shasta-cfg, are used by the installation process to inject CA material in an encrypted form. Vault (cray-vault instance) ultimately sources and stores the CA from a K8S secret (result of decrypting the corresponding Sealed Secret).\nThe resulting CA will be used to sign multiple workloads on the platform (Ingress, mTLS for PostgreSQL Clusters, Spire, \u0026hellip;).\n Management of Sealed Secrets should ideally take place on a secure workstation.\n Use Default Platform Generated CA In shasta-cfg, there is a Sealed Secret generator named platform_ca. By default, the customizations.yaml file will contain a generation template to use this generator, and will create a sealed secret named generated-platform-ca-1. The cray-vault overrides in customizations.yaml contain a) a templated reference to expand the generated-platform-ca-1 Sealed Secret and b) directives instructing vault to load the CA material on start-up \u0026ndash; ultimately initializing a HashiCorp Vault PKI Engine instance with the material.\n Note: the intermediate CA gets installed into Vault, not the root CA (as generated). Use of a root CA is not recommended.\n The resulting default configuration (prior to seeding customizations) should look like the following customizations.yaml snippet:\nspec: ... kubernetes: sealed_secrets: ... gen_platform_ca_1: generate: name: generated-platform-ca-1 data: - type: platform_ca args: root_days: 3651 int_days: 3650 root_cn: \u0026#34;Platform CA\u0026#34; int_cn: \u0026#34;Platform CA - L1\u0026#34; services: ... cray-vault: sealedSecrets: - \u0026#34;{{ kubernetes.sealed_secrets.gen_platform_ca_1 | toYaml }}\u0026#34; pki: customCA: enabled: true secret: generated-platform-ca-1 private_key: int_ca.key certificate: int_ca.crt ca_bundle: root_ca.crt ...  The platform_ca generator will produce RSA CAs with a 3072-bit modulus, using SHA256 as the base signature algorithm.\n Customize Platform Generated CA The platform_ca generator inputs can be customized, if desired. Notably, the root_days, int_days, root_cn, and int_cn fields can be modified. While the shasta-cfg documentation on the use of generators supplies additional detail, the *_days settings control the validity period and the *_cn settings control the common name value for the resulting CA certificates. Ensure the Sealed Secret name reference in spec.kubernetes.services.cray-vault.sealedSecrets is updated if you opt to use a different name.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. Please set validity periods accordingly. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Use External CA The static_platform_ca generator, part of shasta-cfg, can be used to supply an external CA private key, certificate, and associated upstream CAs that form the trust chain. The generator will attempt to prevent you from supplying a root CA. You must also supply the entire trust chain up to the root CA certificate.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. Please ensure validity periods are set accordingly for external CAs you use in this process. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Here is an example customizations.yaml snippet illustrating the generator input to inject a static CA:\nspec: ... kubernetes: sealed_secrets: ... external_platform_ca_1: generate: name: external-platform-ca-1 data: - type: static_platform_ca args: key: |------BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

We check /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases for setting up the symlinks for the artifacts each node needs to boot. So if your BMCs are set to static, those artifacts will not get set up correctly.

An administrator can invoke the cloud-init script at /srv/cray/scripts/metal/set-efi-bbs.sh on any NCN. Find the script here, on GitHub.\n Setting Order This section gives the procedure for setting the boot order on NCNs and the PIT node.\nSetting the boot order with efibootmgr will ensure that the desired network interfaces and disks are in the proper order for booting.\nThe commands are the same for all hardware vendors, except where noted.\n  Create a list of the desired IPv4 boot devices.\nFollow the section corresponding to the hardware manufacturer of the system:\n  Gigabyte Technology\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*adapter)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1   Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i \u0026#39;port 1\u0026#39; | grep -i \u0026#39;pxe ipv4\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1   Intel Corporation\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i \u0026#39;ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -iv \u0026#39;baseboard\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1     Create a list of the cray disk boot devices.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i cray | tee /tmp/bbs2   Set the boot order to first PXE boot, with disk boot as the fallback options.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr -o $(cat /tmp/bbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | tr -t \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/,$//\u0026#39;) | grep -i bootorder   Set all of the desired boot options to be active.\nncn/pit# cat /tmp/bbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | xargs -r -t -i efibootmgr -b {} -a   After following the steps above on a given NCN, that NCN will now use the desired Shasta boot order.\nThis is the end of the Setting Boot Order procedure.\nTrimming Boot Order This section gives the procedure for removing unwanted entries from the boot order on NCNs and the PIT node.\nThis section will only advise on removing other PXE entries. There are too many vendor-specific entries beyond disks and NICs to cover in this section (e.g. BIOS entries, iLO entries, etc.).\nIn this case, the instructions are the same regardless of node type (management, storage, or worker):\n  Make lists of the unwanted boot entries.\n  Gigabyte Technology\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -ivP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*)\u0026#39; | grep -iP \u0026#39;(adapter|connection|nvme|sata)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*)\u0026#39; | grep -i connection | tee /tmp/rbbs2   Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\n NOTE This does not trim HSN Mellanox cards; these should disable their OpROMs using the high speed network snippet(s).\n ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -vi \u0026#39;pxe ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -i adapter |tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(sata|nvme)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs2   Intel Corporation\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -vi \u0026#39;ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -iP \u0026#39;(sata|nvme|uefi)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i baseboard | tee /tmp/rbbs2     Remove them.\nncn/pit# cat /tmp/rbbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | xargs -r -t -i efibootmgr -b {} -B   Your boot menu should be trimmed down to contain only relevant entries.\nThis is the end of the Trimming Boot Order procedure.\nExample Boot Orders   Master node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nncn-m# efibootmgr BootCurrent: 0009 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0004,0000,0007,0009,000B,000D,0012,0013,0002,0003,0001 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* UEFI OS Boot0003* UEFI OS Boot0004* cray (sdb1) Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:62 Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:63 Boot000D* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0012* UEFI: PNY USB 3.1 FD PMAP Boot0013* UEFI: PNY USB 3.1 FD PMAP, Partition 2   Storage node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nncn-s# efibootmgr BootNext: 0005 BootCurrent: 0006 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0007,0009,0000,0002 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* cray (sdb1) Boot0005* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:88:76 Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:88:77 Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection   Worker node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nncn-w# efibootmgr BootNext: 0005 BootCurrent: 0008 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0007,0009,000B,0000,0002 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* cray (sdb1) Boot0005* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - 98:03:9B:AA:88:30 Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:2A Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:2B Boot000D* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection   Reverting Changes This procedure is only needed if you wish to revert boot order changes.\nReset the BIOS.

Operationally these are all that matter; the common layer, Kubernetes layer, Ceph layer, and any other new images.\nTo boot an NCN, you need 3 artifacts for each node-type (kubernetes-manager/worker, ceph):\n The Kubernetes SquashFS ([stable][4] or [unstable][5])  initrd-img-[RELEASE].xz $version-[RELEASE].kernel kubernetes-[RELEASE].squashfs   The CEPH SquashFS ([stable][6] or [unstable][7])  initrd-img-[RELEASE].xz $version-[RELEASE].kernel storage-ceph-[RELEASE].squashfs    LiveCD Server   View the current ephemeral data payload:\npit# ls -l /var/www total 8 drwxr-xr-x 1 dnsmasq tftp 4096 Dec 17 21:20 boot drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Dec 2 04:45 ephemeral pit# ls -l /var/www/ephemeral/data/* /var/www/ephemeral/data/ceph: total 4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec 17 21:42 0.0.7 /var/www/ephemeral/data/k8s: total 4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec 17 21:26 0.0.8   Setup the \u0026ldquo;booting repositories\u0026rdquo;:\npit# set-sqfs-links.sh Mismatching kernels!

Partitioning is controlled by two aspects:\n dracut; this selects disks and builds their partition tables and/or LVM storage. cloud-init; this manages standalone partitions or volumes, as well as high-level object storage.  Plan of Record / Baseline    Node Type No. of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks (0.5 TiB) No. of \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; disks (1.9 TiB)     k8s-master nodes 3 0   k8s-worker nodes 2 1   ceph-storage nodes 2 3+    Disks are chosen by dracut. Kubernetes and storage nodes use different dracut modules.\n First, two disks for the OS are chosen from the pool of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks Second, one disk is selected for the ephemeral data  Problems When Above/Below Baseline The master nodes and worker nodes use the same artifacts, and thus have the same dracut modules assimilating disks. Therefore, it is important to beware of:\n k8s-master nodes with one or more extra \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; disk(s); these disks help but are unnecessary ceph-storage nodes do not run the same dracut modules because they have different disk demands  Worker Nodes with ETCD k8s-worker nodes with 1 or more extra \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disk(s); these disks are confusing and unnecessary and can be disabled easily.\nDisable Luks  NOTE This is broken, use the expand RAID option instead. (MTL-1309)\n All NCNs (master/worker/storage) have the same kernel parameters, but are not always necessary. This method works by toggling the dependency for the metal ETCD module, disabling LUKs will disable ETCD bare-metal creation.\n  Disable LUKs for each worker node, thus disabling the metal ETCD module:\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts rd.luks /disk-opts rd.luks=0 /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param rd.luks=0     Rebuild the node\n Run the basic wipe if the node was already booted (re)boot the node    Expand the RAID This option simply expands the RAID to consume the extra disks, leaving none behind for the metal ETCD module to find.\n  Set metal.disks equal to the number of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks in the node(s), this will reserve them for the RAID and prevent any other partitioning from happening on them.\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts /disk-opts metal.disks=3 /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param metal.disks=3     Change the RAID type, or leave it as default (mirror)\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts /disk-opts metal.md-level=stripe /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param metal.md-level=stripe     Rebuild the node\n Run the basic wipe if the node was already booted (re)boot the node    Disk Layout Quick-Reference Tables The table below represents all recognizable FS labels on any given management node, varying slightly by node role (Kubernetes master or Kubernetes worker).\n   k8s-master k8s-worker storage-ceph FS Label Partitions Device Partition Size OverlayFS Work Order(s) Memo     ✅ ✅ ✅ BOOTRAID /metal/recovery 2 small disks in RAID1 500 MiB ❌ Present since Shasta-Preview 1    ✅ ✅ ✅ SQFSRAID /run/initramfs/live 2 small disks in RAID1 25 GiB ✅ CASM-1885 squashfs should compress our images to about 1/3rd their uncompressed size.

These enable two critical functions; changes to data and new data will persist between reboots, and RAM (memory) is freed because we are using our block-devices (SATA/PCIe).\n ROOTRAID is the persistent root overlayFS, it commits and saves all changes made to the running OS and it stands on a RAID1 mirror. CONLIB is a persistent overlayFS for containerd, it commits and saves all new changes while allowing read-through to pre-existing (baked-in) data from the squashFS. ETCDK8S is a persistent overlayFS for etcd, it works like the CONLIB overlayFS however this exists in an encrypted LUKS2 partition.  OverlayFS Example  Helpful commands\u0026hellip; the overlayFS organization can be best viewed with these three commands:\n lsblk, lsblk -f will show how the RAIDs and disks are mounted losetup -a will show where the squashFS is mounted from mount | grep ' / ' will show you the overlay being layered atop the squashFS   Let us pick apart the SQFSRAID and ROOTRAID overlays.\n /run/rootfsbase is the SquashFS image itself /run/initramfs/live is the squashFS\u0026rsquo;s storage array, where one or more squashFS can live /run/initramfs/overlayfs is the overlayFS storage array, where the persistent directories live /run/overlayfs and /run/ovlwork are symlinks to `/run/initramfs/overlayfs/overlayfs-SQFSRAID-$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/disk/by-label/SQFSRAID) and the neighboring work directory Admin note: The \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; directory is where the operating system processes data. It is the interim where data passes between RAM and persistent storage.  Using the above bullets, one may be able to better understand the machine output below:\nncn-m002# mount | grep \u0026#39; / \u0026#39; LiveOS_rootfs on / type overlay (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/run/rootfsbase,upperdir=/run/overlayfs,workdir=/run/ovlwork) ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ncn-m002# losetup -a /dev/loop1: [0025]:74858 (/run/initramfs/thin-overlay/meta) /dev/loop2: [0025]:74859 (/run/initramfs/thin-overlay/data) /dev/loop0: [2430]:100 (/run/initramfs/live/LiveOS/filesystem.squashfs)  The THIN OVERLAY is the transient space the system uses behind the scenes to allow data to live in RAM as it is written to disk. The THIN part of the overlay is the magic, using THIN overlays means the kernel will automatically clear free blocks.\n Below is the layout of what a persistent system looks like. Note, this means that persistent capacity is there, but administrators should beware of reset toggles on unfamiliar systems. There are toggles to reset overlays that are, by default, toggled off (so data persistence be default is safe but one should not assume).\nncn-m002# lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT loop0 7:0 0 3.8G 1 loop /run/rootfsbase loop1 7:1 0 30G 0 loop └─live-overlay-pool 254:2 0 300G 0 dm loop2 7:2 0 300G 0 loop └─live-overlay-pool 254:2 0 300G 0 dm sda 8:0 1 447.1G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 1 476M 0 part │ └─md127 9:127 0 476M 0 raid1 ├─sda2 8:2 1 92.7G 0 part │ └─md126 9:126 0 92.6G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/live └─sda3 8:3 1 279.4G 0 part └─md125 9:125 0 279.3G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/overlayfs sdb 8:16 1 447.1G 0 disk ├─sdb1 8:17 1 476M 0 part │ └─md127 9:127 0 476M 0 raid1 ├─sdb2 8:18 1 92.7G 0 part │ └─md126 9:126 0 92.6G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/live └─sdb3 8:19 1 279.4G 0 part └─md125 9:125 0 279.3G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/overlayfs sdc 8:32 1 447.1G 0 disk └─ETCDLVM 254:0 0 447.1G 0 crypt └─etcdvg0-ETCDK8S 254:1 0 32G 0 lvm /run/lib-etcd Persistent Directories Not all directories are persistent!\nOnly the following directories are persistent by default:\n etc home root srv tmp var /run/containerd /run/lib-containerd /run/lib-etcd /run/lib/kubelet  More directories can be added, but mileage varies. The initial set is actually managed by dracut, when using a reset toggle the above list is \u0026ldquo;reset/cleared\u0026rdquo;. If more directories are added, they will be eradicated when enabling a reset toggle.\nThese are all provided through the Overlay from /run/overlayfs:\nncn-m001:/run/overlayfs # ls -l total 0 drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 290 Oct 15 22:41 etc drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 18 Oct 15 22:41 home drwx------ 3 root root 39 Oct 13 16:53 root drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 18 Oct 5 19:16 srv drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 85 Oct 16 14:50 tmp drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 76 Oct 13 16:52 var  Remember: /run/overlayfs is a symbolic link to the real disk /run/initramfs/overlayfs/*.\n Layering - Upperdir and Lowerdir(s) The file system the user is working on is really two layered file systems (overlays).\n The lower layer is the SquashFS image itself, read-only, which provides all that we need to run. The upper layer is the OverlayFS, read-write, which does a bit-wise xor with the lower-layer Anything in the upper-layer takes precedence by default.   There are fancier options for overlays, such as multiple lower-layers, copy-up (lower-layer precedence), and opaque (removing a directory in the upper layer hides it in the lower layer). You can read more [here|https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html#inode-properties]\n Layering Real World Example Let us take /root for example, we can see in the upper-dir (the overlay) we have these files:\nThe upper-dir has these files:\nncn-m001# ls -l /run/overlayfs/root/ total 4 -rw------- 1 root root 252 Nov 4 18:23 .bash_history drwxr-x--- 4 root root 37 Nov 4 04:35 .kube drwx------ 2 root root 29 Oct 21 21:57 .ssh Then in the squashFS image (lower-dir) we have these\u0026hellip;\nncn-m001# ls -l /run/rootfsbase/root/ total 1 -rw------- 1 root root 0 Oct 19 15:31 .bash_history drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 bin drwx------ 3 root root 26 Oct 21 22:07 .cache drwx------ 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 .gnupg drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 57 Oct 19 15:23 inst-sys drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 33 Oct 19 15:33 .kbd drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 53 Oct 19 15:34 spire drwx------ 2 root root 70 Oct 21 21:57 .ssh -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 172 Oct 26 15:25 .wget-hsts  Notice how the .bash_history file in the lower-dir is 0 bytes, but it is 252 bytes in the upperdir? Notice the .kube dir exists in the upper, but not the lower?  Finally, looking at /root we see the magic:\nncn-m001# ls -l /root total 5 -rw------- 1 root root 252 Nov 4 18:23 .bash_history drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 bin drwx------ 3 root root 26 Oct 21 22:07 .cache drwx------ 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 .gnupg drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 57 Oct 19 15:23 inst-sys drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 33 Oct 19 15:33 .kbd drwxr-x--- 4 root root 37 Nov 4 04:35 .kube drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 53 Oct 19 15:34 spire drwx------ 1 root root 29 Oct 21 21:57 .ssh -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 172 Oct 26 15:25 .wget-hsts  Notice how .bash_history matches the upper-dir? Notice how .kube exists here?  The take-away here is: any change done to /root/ will persist through /run/overlayfs/root and will take precedence to the squashFS image root.\nOverlayFS Control These features or toggles are passable on the kernel command line, and change the behavior of the overlayFS.\nReset Toggles The overlay FS provides a few reset toggles to clear out the persistence directories without reinstall.\nThe toggles require rebooting.\nReset On Next Boot The preferred way to reset persistent storage is to use the overlayFS reset toggle.\nModify the boot command line on the PXE server, adding this\n# Reset the overlay on boot rd.live.overlay.reset=1 Once reset, you may want to enable persistence again. Simply revert your change and the next reboot will persist.\n# Cease resetting the overlayFS rd.live.overlay.reset=0 Reset on Every Boot There are two options one can leave enabled to accomplish this:\n rd.live.overlay.reset=1 will eradicate/recreate the overlay every reboot. rd.live.overlay.readonly=1 will clear the overlay on every reboot.  For long-term usage, rd.live.overlay.readonly=1 should be added to the command line.\nThe reset=1 toggle is usually used to fix a problematic overlay. If you want to refresh and purge the overlay completely, then use rd.live.overlay.reset.\n# Authorize METAL to purge metal.no-wipe=0 rd.live.overlay.reset=1  Note: metal.no-wipe=1 does not protect against rd.live.overlay.reset, metal.no-wipe is not a feature of dmsquash-live.\n Re-sizing the Persistent Overlay  Default Size: 300 GiB File System: XFS  The overlay can be resized to fit a variety of needs or use cases. The size is provided directly on the command line. Any value can be provided, but it must be in megabytes.\nIf you are resetting the overlay on a deployed node, you will need to also set rd.live.overlay.reset=1.\nIt is recommended to set the size before deployment. There is a linkage between the metal-dracut module and the live-module that makes this inflexible.\n# Use a 300 GiB overlayFS (default) rd.live.overlay.size=307200 # Use a 1 TiB overlayFS rd.live.overlay.size=1000000 Thin Overlay Feature The persistent overlayFS leverages newer, \u0026ldquo;thin\u0026rdquo; overlays that support discards and that will free blocks that are not claimed by the file system. This means that memory is free/released when the file system does not claim it anymore.\nThin overlays can be disabled, and instead classic DM Snapshots can be used to manage the overlay. This will use more RAM. It is not recommended, because dmraid is not included in the initrd.\n# Enable (default) rd.live.overlay.thin=1 # Disable (not recommended; undesirable RAM waste) rd.live.overlay.thin=0 SystemD MetalFS The metalfs systemd service will try to mount any metal created partitions.\nThis runs against the /run/initramfs/overlayfs/fstab.metal when it exists. This file is dynamically created by most metal dracut modules.\nThe service will continuously attempt to mount the partitions, if problems arise please stop the service:\nncn# systemctl stop metalfs Old/Retired FS-Labels Deprecated FS labels/partitions from Shasta 1.3.X (no longer in Shasta 1.4.0 and onwards).\n   FS Label Partitions Nodes Device Size on Disk Work Order Memo     K8SKUBE /var/lib/kubelet ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral Max/Remainder CASMPET-338 CASMPET-342 No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4   K8SEPH /var/lib/cray/k8s_ephemeral ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral Max/Remainder CASMPET-338 CASMPET-342 No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4   CRAYINSTALL /var/cray/vfat ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 12 GiB CASMPET-338 CASMPET-342 No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4   CRAYVBIS /var/cray/vbis ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 900 GiB CASMPET-338 CASMPET-342 No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4   CRAYNFS /var/lib/nfsroot/nmd ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 12 GiB CASMPET-338 CASMPET-342 No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4   CRAYSDU /var/lib/sdu all masters and workers LVM 100 GiB MTL-1292 MTL-1562 Implemented in MTL-1292 and refactored in MTL-1562    "

It also helps show us when driver issues occur, if a non-BIOSDEVNAME interface appears then METAL can/should receive a triage report/bug.\nThe MAC based udev rules set the interfaces during initial boot in iPXE. When a node boots, iPXE will dump the PCI busses and sort network interfaces into 3 buckets:\n mgmt: internal/management network connection sun: internal/storage network connection hsn: high-speed connection lan: external/site-connection  The source code for the rule generation is in [metal-ipxe][1], but for technical information on the PCI configuration/reading please read on.\nVendor and Bus ID Identification The initial boot of an NCN sets interface udev rules because it has no discovery method yet.\nThe information needed is:\n PCI Vendor IDs for devices/cards to be used on the Management network.

The 16-bit Vendor ID is allocated by the PCI-SIG (Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group).\nThe information belongs to the first 4 bytes of the PCI header, and admin can obtain it using lspci or your preferred method for reading the PCI bus.\nlspci | grep -i ethernet lspci | grep c6:00.0 The Device and Vendor IDs are used in iPXE for bootstrapping the nodes, this allows generators to swap IDs out for certain systems until smarter logic can be added to cloud-init.\nThe following table includes popular vendor and device IDs.\n The bolded numbers are the defaults that live in metal-ipxe\u0026rsquo;s boot script.\n    Vendor Model Device ID Vendor ID     Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection X722 37d2 8086   Intel Corporation 82576 1526 8086   Mellanox Technologies ConnectX-4 1013 15b3   Mellanox Technologies ConnectX-5 1017 15b3   Giga-Byte Intel Corporation I350 1521 8086   QLogic Corporation FastLinQ QL41000 8070 1077    "

PXE Retry Count 0 Attempts done on a single boot-menu option (note: 2 should be set for systems with unsolved network congestion). If networking is working nominally, then the interface either works or does not. Retrying the same NIC should not work, if it does then there are networking problems that need to be addressed. Within the Networking Menu, and then under Network Boot.   PXE Timeout 5 Seconds (or less, never more) The time that the PXE ROM will wait for a DHCP handshake to complete before moving on to the next boot device. If DHCP is working nominally, then the DHCP handshake should not take longer than 5 seconds. This timeout could be increased where networking faults cannot be reconciled, but ideally this should be tuned to 3 or 2 seconds.    Continuous Boot Disabled Whether boot-group (e.g. all network devices, or all disk devices) should continuously retry. This prevents fall-through to the fallback disks. We want deterministic nodes in Shasta, if the boot fails the first tier we want the node to try the next tier of boot mediums before failing at a shell or menu for intervention.
